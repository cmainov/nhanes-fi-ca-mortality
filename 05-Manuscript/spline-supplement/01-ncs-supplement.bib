	abstract = {A key hallmark of many cancers, particularly the most aggressive, is the capacity to metabolize glucose at an elevated rate, a phenotype detected clinically using positron emission tomography (PET). This phenotype provides cancer cells, including those that participate in metastasis, a distinct competitive edge over normal cells. Specifically, after rapid entry of glucose into cancer cells on the glucose transporter, the highly glycolytic phenotype is supported by hexokinase (primarily HK II) that is overexpressed and bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane via the porin-like protein voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). This protein and the adenine nucleotide transporter move ATP, newly synthesized by the inner membrane located ATP synthase, to active sites on HK II. The abundant amounts of HK II bind both the ATP and the incoming glucose producing the product glucose-6-phosphate, also at an elevated rate. This critical metabolite then serves both as a biosynthetic precursor to support cell proliferation and as a precursor for lactic acid, the latter exiting cancer cells causing an unfavorable environment for normal cells. Although helping facilitate this chemical warfare, HK II via its mitochondrial location also suppresses the death of cancer cells, thus increasing their possibility for metastasis and the ultimate death of the human host. For these reasons, targeting this key enzyme is currently being investigated in several laboratories in a strategy to develop novel therapies that may turn the tide on the continuing struggle to find effective cures for cancer. One such candidate is 3-bromopyruvate that has been shown recently to eradicate advanced stage, PET positive hepatocellular carcinomas in an animal model without apparent harm to the animals.},

	abstract = {Transformed cells are highly glycolytic and overexpress hexokinase II (HXK II). HXK II is capable of binding to the mitochondria through an interaction with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), an abundant outer mitochondrial membrane protein. The binding of HXK II to mitochondria has been shown to protect against loss of cell viability. Akt activation inhibits apoptosis partly by promoting the binding of HXK II to the mitochondria, but the mechanism through which Akt accomplishes this has not been characterized. The present report shows that Akt mediates the binding of HXK II to the mitochondria by negatively regulating the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). On inhibition of Akt, GSK3beta is activated and phosphorylates VDAC. HXK II is unable to bind VDAC phosphorylated by GSK3beta and dissociates from the mitochondria. Inhibition of Akt potentiates chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity, an effect that is dependent on GSK3beta activation and its attendant ability to disrupt the binding of HXK II to the mitochondria. Moreover, agents that can force the detachment of HXK II from mitochondria in the absence of Akt inhibition or GSK3beta activation promoted a synergistic increase in cell killing when used in conjunction with chemotherapeutic drugs. Such findings indicate that interference with the binding of HXK II to mitochondria may be a practicable modality by which to potentiate the efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents.},

Aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect links the high rate of glucose fermentation to cancer. Together with glutamine, glucose via glycolysis provides the carbon skeletons, NADPH, and ATP to build new cancer cells, which persist in hypoxia that in turn rewires metabolic pathways for cell growth and survival. Excessive caloric intake is associated with an increased risk for cancers, while caloric restriction is protective, perhaps through clearance of mitochondria or mitophagy, thereby reducing oxidative stress. Hence, the links between metabolism and cancer are multifaceted, spanning from the low incidence of cancer in large mammals with low specific metabolic rates to altered cancer cell metabolism resulting from mutated enzymes or cancer genes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cancer cells alter their metabolism in order to support their rapid proliferation and expansion across the body. In particular, tumor cells, rather than fueling glucose in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, generally use glucose for aerobic glycolysis. In this review, we discuss some of the mechanisms thought to be responsible for the acquisition of a glycolytic phenotype in cancer cells and how the switch towards glycolysis represents a selective growth advantage.
RECENT FINDINGS: Glucose deprivation can activate oncogenes and these can upregulate proteins involved in aerobic glycolysis. In turn, proteins implicated in increased glycolysis can render tumor cells more resistant to apoptosis. Aerobic glycolysis induces acidification of the tumor environment, favoring the development of a more aggressive and invasive phenotype. Altering the pH around tumors might represent a way to hamper tumor development as suggested by a recent work demonstrating that bicarbonate, which increases the pH of tumors, prevented spontaneous metastatization.
SUMMARY: The acquisition of a glycolytic phenotype by transformed cells confers a selective growth advantage to these cells. Interfering with aerobic glycolysis, therefore, represents a potentially effective strategy to selectively target cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Although limited data exist, electrode-measured pH values of human tumors and adjacent normal tissues, which are concurrently obtained by the same investigator in the same patient, consistently show that the electrode pH (believed to primarily represent tissue extracellular pH) is substantially and consistently lower in the tumor than in normal tissue. In contrast, the 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimated that intracellular pH is essentially identical or slightly more basic in tumor compared to normal tissue. As a consequence, the cellular pH gradient is substantially reduced or reversed in tumor compared to normal tissue: in normal tissue the extracellular pH is relatively basic, and in tumor tissue the magnitude of the pH gradient is reduced or reversed. The difference provides an exploitable avenue for the treatment of cancer. The extent to which drugs exhibiting weakly acid or basic properties are ionized is strongly dependent on the pH of their milieu. Weakly acidic drugs which are relatively lipid soluble in their nonionized state may diffuse freely across the cell membrane and, upon entering a relatively basic intracellular compartment, become trapped and accumulate within a cell, leading to substantial differences in the intracellular/extracellular drug distribution between tumor and normal tissue for drugs exhibiting appropriate pKas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have found that a ketogenic diet (KD) during the course of radiotherapy (RT) was feasible and led to a preservation or favorable changes of body composition. Based on these observations and theoretical considerations, we initiated a study to investigate the impact of a KD or a ketogenic breakfast intervention in patients undergoing RT.
METHODS: All patients presenting for curative RT with age between 18 and 75, body mass index between 18 and 34 kg/m2 and a histologically confirmed cancer of the breast, colorectum or head and neck region are considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria are Karnofsky index {\textless}70, pregnancy, metallic body parts that interfere with bioimpedance analysis (BIA), type I diabetes, known enzyme defects that contradict a KD and renal insufficiency. Randomization is achieved by all consecutive patients first entering the control group and then an intervention group 1 until both groups contain 15 breast, 15 colorectal and 5 head and neck cancer patients. Intervention group 1 will receive each radiotherapy fraction after an overnight fast and subsequently ingest a ketogenic breakfast consisting of (i) 50-250 ml of a medium-chain triglyceride drink (betaquick®, vitaflo, Bad Homburg, Germany) plus (ii) 5-15 g amino acids (MAP, dr. reinwald healthcare gmbh+co kg, Schwarzenbruck, Germany). If willing to undertake a complete KD for the duration of RT, patients are entered into intervention group 2. Intervention group 2 does not have to fast prior to RT fractions but will be supplemented with MAP analogous to intervention group 1. The control group will not receive dietary advice to follow a KD or reduce carbohydrate intake. The objective is twofold: (i) to test whether the ketogenic interventions are feasibly, as measured by the number of dropouts; (ii) to see whether intervention groups 1 and 2 attain a better preservation of BIA phase angle than the control group.
ENDPOINTS: Primary endpoints are the feasibility of the interventions (measured through dropout rates), and changes in body weight and composition (measured through BIA). Secondary endpoints are changes in quality of life (EORTC questionnaires) and blood parameters as well as the occurrence and grade of toxicities and grade of regression after surgery in case of colorectal carcinomas.},

	abstract = {Over the last years, evidence has accumulated suggesting that by systematically reducing the amount of dietary carbohydrates (CHOs) one could suppress, or at least delay, the emergence of cancer, and that proliferation of already existing tumor cells could be slowed down. This hypothesis is supported by the association between modern chronic diseases like the metabolic syndrome and the risk of developing or dying from cancer. CHOs or glucose, to which more complex carbohydrates are ultimately digested, can have direct and indirect effects on tumor cell proliferation: first, contrary to normal cells, most malignant cells depend on steady glucose availability in the blood for their energy and biomass generating demands and are not able to metabolize significant amounts of fatty acids or ketone bodies due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Second, high insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels resulting from chronic ingestion of CHO-rich Western diet meals, can directly promote tumor cell proliferation via the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway. Third, ketone bodies that are elevated when insulin and blood glucose levels are low, have been found to negatively affect proliferation of different malignant cells in vitro or not to be usable by tumor cells for metabolic demands, and a multitude of mouse models have shown anti-tumorigenic properties of very low CHO ketogenic diets. In addition, many cancer patients exhibit an altered glucose metabolism characterized by insulin resistance and may profit from an increased protein and fat intake.In this review, we address the possible beneficial effects of low CHO diets on cancer prevention and treatment. Emphasis will be placed on the role of insulin and IGF1 signaling in tumorigenesis as well as altered dietary needs of cancer patients.},

However, there is growing evidence that aberrant insulin level and insulin-mediated signaling can lead to cancer development and progression. The insulin-cancer relationship has stemmed from various observational and epidemiological studies, which linked higher incidence of cancer with central obesity, type II diabetes and other conditions associated with increased levels of circulating insulin, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemic states. Increased risk of developing a range of cancers is also seen with a certain treatment options used to lower blood glucose level in diabetic patients. While metformin monotherapy has the lowest risk of developing cancer, in comparison, treatment with insulin or insulin secretagogues shows more likelihood to develop solid cancers. Cellular signaling initiated by insulin provides a clue regarding these diverse cellular outcomes.

Moreover, IR isoform A (IR-A) together with autocrine production of its ligand IGF2 is emerging as an important mechanism of normal and cancer stem cell expansion and is a feature of several malignancies. De novo activation of the IR-A/IGF2 autocrine loop also represents a mechanism of resistance to anticancer therapies. Increasing knowledge of the IR role in cancer has important implications for cancer prevention, which should include control of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in the population and meticulous evaluation of new antidiabetic drugs for their metabolic:mitogenic ratio. We are now aware that several anticancer treatments may induce or worsen insulin resistance that may limit therapy efficacy.

	abstract = {AIM: It has been suggested that chronic hyperinsulinemia from insulin resistance is involved in the etiology of endometrial cancer (EC). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether insulin resistance is associated with the risk of EC.
METHODS: We searched PubMed-Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published from database inception through 30th September 2014. We included all observational studies evaluating components defining insulin resistance in women with and without EC. Quality of the included studies was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random-effects models and inverse variance method were used to meta-analyze the association between insulin resistance components and EC.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. Fasting insulin levels (13 studies, n = 4088) were higher in women with EC (mean difference [MD] 33.94 pmol/L, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 15.04-52.85, p = 0.0004). No differences were seen in postmenopausal versus pre- and postmenopausal subgroup analysis. Similarly, non-fasting/fasting C-peptide levels (five studies, n = 1938) were also higher in women with EC (MD 0.14 nmol/L, 95\% CI 0.08-0.21, p {\textless} 0.00001). Homeostatic model assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values (six studies, n = 1859) in EC patients were significantly higher than in women without EC (MD 1.13, 95\% CI 0.20-2.06, p = 0.02). There was moderate-to-high heterogeneity among the included studies.
CONCLUSION: Currently available epidemiologic evidence is suggestive of significantly higher risk of EC in women with high fasting insulin, non-fasting/fasting C-peptide and HOMA-IR values.},

	abstract = {Background: Although insulin may increase the risk of some cancers, few studies have examined fasting serum insulin and lung cancer risk.Methods: We examined serum insulin, glucose, and indices of insulin resistance [insulin:glucose molar ratio and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)] and lung cancer risk using a case-cohort study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study of Finnish men. A total of 196 cases and 395 subcohort members were included. Insulin and glucose were measured in fasting serum collected 5 to 12 years before diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to estimate the relative risk of lung cancer.Results: The average time between blood collection and lung cancer was 9.6 years. Fasting serum insulin levels were 8.7\% higher in subcohort members than cases. After multivariable adjustment, men in the fourth quartile of insulin had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer than those in the first quartile [HR = 2.10; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-3.94]. A similar relationship was seen with HOMA-IR (HR = 1.83; 95\% CI, 0.99-3.38). Risk was not strongly associated with glucose or the insulin:glucose molar ratio (Ptrend = 0.55 and Ptrend = 0.27, respectively).Conclusions: Higher fasting serum insulin concentrations, as well as the presence of insulin resistance, appear to be associated with an elevated risk of lung cancer development.Impact: Although insulin is hypothesized to increase risk of some cancers, insulin and lung cancer remain understudied. Higher insulin levels and insulin resistance were associated with increased lung cancer risk. Although smoking cessation is the best method of lung cancer prevention, other lifestyle changes that affect insulin concentrations and sensitivity may reduce lung cancer risk.

	abstract = {One of the greatest obstacles to current cancer treatment efforts is the development of drug resistance by tumors. Despite recent advances in diagnostic practices and surgical interventions, many neoplasms demonstrate poor response to adjuvant or neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. As a result, the prognosis for many patients afflicted with these aggressive cancers remains bleak. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling axis has been shown to play critical role in the development and progression of various tumors. Many basic science and translational studies have shown that IGF pathway modulators can have promising effects when used to treat various malignancies. There also exists a substantial body of recent evidence implicating IGF signaling dysregulation in the dwindling response of tumors to current standard-of-care therapy. By better understanding both the IGF-dependent and -independent mechanisms by which pathway members can influence drug sensitivity, we can eventually aim to use modulators of IGF signaling to augment the effects of current therapy. This review summarizes and synthesizes numerous recent investigations looking at the role of the IGF pathway in drug resistance. We offer a brief overview of IGF signaling and its general role in neoplasia, and then delve into detail about the many types of human cancer that have been shown to have IGF pathway involvement in resistance and/or sensitization to therapy. Ultimately, our hope is that such a compilation of evidence will compel investigators to carry out much needed studies looking at combination treatment with IGF signaling modulators to overcome current therapy resistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) has been implicated in carcinogenesis, but there is no consensus regarding its involvement in ovarian cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between IR and ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Searches were conducted in five databases for studies evaluating IR markers (levels of serum insulin, C peptide, insulin growth factor [IGF] 1 and IGF-binding proteins [IGFBPs], homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance, and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index) and ovarian cancer risk. Study selection, data extraction and an assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by three researchers. The associations between IR markers and ovarian cancer were quantified as mean differences (MDs) or standardized MDs (SMDs) and their 95\% CIs using random-effects models.
RESULTS: Fourteen case-control studies satisfied our inclusion criteria (n=8130). There was little information on IR markers with the exception of the IGF system. Ovarian cancer was associated with lower IGF-1 levels (SMD -0.43ng/mL, 95\% CI -0.67 to -0.18; p=0.0006), and lower IGFBP-3 levels (SMD -0.11ng/mL, 95\% CI -0.21 to -0.00; p=0.04). However, ovarian cancer was associated with higher levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-1 (MD 527.3ng/mL, 95\%CI 473.6, 581.0; p{\textless}0.00001, and MD 3.47ng/mL, 95\%CI 1.42, 5.52; p=0.0009 respectively). Subgroup analyses by menopausal status and age (≤55 vs {\textgreater}55y) for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 showed the subgroups were similar, although heterogeneity remained high.
CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are lower in patients with ovarian cancer. In contrast, higher levels of IGBP-2 and IGBP-1 are found in patients with ovarian cancer.},

It has been hypothesized that one of the underlying mechanisms for this risk could be mediated by variations in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This review summarizes the current epidemiological evidence to identify whether IGF-1 plays a role in the development of SPCs. IGF-1 is known to promote cancer development by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating cell proliferation. Epidemiological studies have reported a positive association between circulating IGF-1 levels and various primary cancers, such as breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. The role of IGF-1 in increasing SPC risk has been explored less. Nonetheless, several experimental studies have observed a deregulation of the IGF-1 pathway, which may explain the association between IGF-1 and SPCs. Thus, measuring serum IGF-1 may serve as a useful marker in assessing the risk of SPCs, and therefore, more translational experimental and epidemiological studies are needed to further disentangle the role of IGF-1 in the development of specific SPCs.},

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0762},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Second primary tumors (SPTs) are a hallmark of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Serum levels of insulin growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) have been associated with subsequent development of several epithelial cancers in prospective studies.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To examine the role of IGFs in SPT development, we conducted a nested case-control study within a randomized, placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial in patients with early-stage HNSCC. We compared prediagnostic serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in 80 patients who subsequently developed SPTs and 173 controls (patients without SPTs) matched to the cases on age (+/-5 years), sex, ethnicity, year of randomization, and length of follow-up.
RESULTS: The cases exhibited significantly higher levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 than did the controls (P = 0.001 and 0.019, respectively). Elevated IGF-I levels were associated with a 3.66-fold significantly increased risk of SPT. Lower and higher IGFBP-3 levels were associated with a 2.22- and 7.12-fold significant increased risk, respectively. The median SPT-free time was significantly shorter in patients with higher IGF-I levels than in patients with lower IGF-I levels (P {\textless} 0.0001). A similar trend was observed for IGFBP-3 (P = 0.002). Moreover, in the Cox proportional hazards model, higher IGF-I levels were significantly associated with increased risk of SPT with a hazard ratio of 2.78. Patients with the lower and higher IGFBP-3 levels also exhibited significantly increased risks with hazard ratios of 1.65 and 2.17, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that higher IGF-I levels, and lower and higher IGFBP-3 levels are risk factors for SPT development. Thus, measuring serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels may be useful markers in assessing the risk of second tumors in patients successfully treated for their index cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, a mitogenic and antiapoptotic peptide, can affect the proliferation of breast epithelial cells, and is thought to have a role in breast cancer. We hypothesised that high circulating IGF-I concentrations would be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
METHODS: We carried out a nested case-control study within the prospective Nurses' Health Study cohort. Plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) were measured in blood samples collected in 1989-90. We identified 397 women who had a diagnosis of breast cancer after this date and 620 age-matched controls. IGF-I concentrations were compared by logistic regression with adjustment for other breast-cancer risk factors.
FINDINGS: There was no association between IGF-I concentrations and breast-cancer risk among the whole study group. In postmenopausal women there was no association between IGF-I concentrations and breast-cancer risk (top vs bottom quintile of IGF-I, relative risk 0.85 [95\% CI 0.53-1.39]). The relative risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women by IGF-I concentration (top vs bottom tertile) was 2.33 (1.06-5.16; p for trend 0.08). Among premenopausal women less than 50 years old at the time of blood collection, the relative risk was 4.58 (1.75-12.0; p for trend 0.02). After further adjustment for plasma IGFBP-3 concentrations these relative risks were 2.88 and 7.28, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: A positive relation between circulating IGF-I concentration and risk of breast cancer was found among premenopausal but not postmenopausal women. Plasma IGF-I concentrations may be useful in the identification of women at high risk of breast cancer and in the development of risk reduction strategies. Additional larger studies of this association among premenopausal women are needed to provide more precise estimates of effect.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies updated to January 2015. Summary relative risks (RRs) were derived using random effects models. Seventy-five reports were evaluated in the systematic review (147,090 cases), and 72 were included in the meta-analyses by cancer site. Considering hormone-related cancers, summary RRs comparing the highest versus the lowest GI and GL intake were, respectively, 1.05 and 1.07 for breast, 1.13 and 1.17 for endometrial, 1.11 and 1.19 for ovarian, and 1.06 and 1.04 for prostate cancers. Considering digestive-tract cancers, summary RRs for GI and GL were, respectively, 1.46 and 1.25 for esophageal (squamous cell carcinoma), 1.17 and 1.10 for stomach, 1.16 (significant) and 1.10 for colorectal, 1.11 and 1.14 for liver, and 1.10 and 1.01 for pancreatic cancers. In most of these meta-analyses, significant heterogeneity among studies was observed. In subgroup analyses, case-control studies and studies from Europe tended to estimate higher RRs.

DATA SYNTHESIS: Medline was searched for cohort studies, case-control studies, and meta-analyses, published up to February 2016, that examined associations between dietary GI/GL and cancer. Findings from the main meta-analyses showed a weak-to-moderate association of high dietary GI/GL with increased risk of some cancers. High dietary GI but not GL was significantly and consistently associated with increased colorectal cancer risk in both cohort and case-control studies. Dietary GL was directly associated with breast and endometrial cancer risk in cohort studies. Positive associations between dietary GI or GL and cancer risk were found more frequently in case-control studies than cohort studies. The main mechanism for these associations is thought to be chronic hyperinsulinemia. Insulin is itself a mitogen and also increases the bioactivity of insulin-like growth factors which can promote cancer by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: The review has uncovered consistent evidence that high dietary GI is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer, and that high dietary GL is associated with increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer. However the risk increases are small or moderate.},

The incidence of 24 types of cancer in 39 European countries (2012) was compared with a long-term mean supply of 68 food items from the FAOSTAT database (1993-2011) and some other variables such as smoking, body mass index, raised cholesterol, and socioeconomic indicators. In addition to simple Pearson linear correlations, the data were analyzed via factor analyses and penalized regression methods. This comparison identified two main groups of cancers that are characteristically associated with the same variables. The first group consists of cancers of the prostate, breast, white blood cells, and melanoma. Their incidence increases with rising gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a prevalence of raised cholesterol and a high intake of animal products. The second group includes primarily cancers of the digestive tract and is most consistently correlated with alcoholic beverages, lard, and eggs. In addition, we found specific correlations between certain variables and some other types of cancer (smoking-lung and larynx cancer; low GDP per capita and high carbohydrate consumption-stomach and cervical cancer; tea drinking-esophageal cancer; maize consumption and wine drinking-liver cancer). The documented findings often remarkably agree with the current scientific consensus, and when combined with evidence based on different methodologies, they can further extend our knowledge of the etiology of cancer. In addition, our study also identifies several foods with possible preventive effects and indicates that various dairy products may markedly differ in their relationship to cancer incidence. All these data can potentially be of fundamental importance for clinical practice and the survival of cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Some factors related to Westernization or industrialization increase risk of colon cancer. It is believed widely that this increase in risk is related to the direct effects of dietary fat and fiber in the colonic lumen. However, the fat and fiber hypotheses, at least as originally formulated, do not explain adequately many emerging findings from recent epidemiologic studies. An alternative hypothesis, that hyperinsulinemia promotes colon carcinogenesis, is presented here. Insulin is an important growth factor of colonic epithelial cells and is a mitogen of tumor cell growth in vitro. Epidemiologic evidence supporting the insulin/colon-cancer hypothesis is largely indirect and based on the similarity of factors which produce elevated insulin levels with those related to colon cancer risk. Specifically, obesity--particularly central obesity, physical inactivity, and possibly a low dietary polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat ratio--are major determinants of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and appear related to colon cancer risk. Moreover, a diet high in refined carbohydrates and low in water-soluble fiber, which is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, causes rapid intestinal absorption of glucose into the blood leading to postprandial hyperinsulinemia. The combination of insulin resistance and high glycemic load produces particularly high insulin levels. Thus, hyperinsulinemia may explain why obesity, physical inactivity, and a diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat and extensively processed foods, all common in the West, increase colon cancer risk.},

	abstract = {Although diet is believed to influence colorectal cancer risk, the long-term effects of a diet with a high glycemic load are unclear. The growing recognition that colorectal cancer may be promoted by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance suggests that a diet inducing high blood glucose levels and an elevated insulin response may contribute to a metabolic environment conducive to tumor growth. We prospectively followed a cohort of 38 451 women for an average of 7.9 years and identified 174 with incident colorectal cancer. We used baseline dietary intake measurements, assessed with a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire, to examine the associations of dietary glycemic load, overall dietary glycemic index, carbohydrate, fiber, nonfiber carbohydrate, sucrose, and fructose with the subsequent development of colorectal cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs). Dietary glycemic load was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (adjusted RR = 2.85, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.40 to 5.80, comparing extreme quintiles of dietary glycemic load; P(trend) =.004) and was associated, although not statistically significantly, with overall glycemic index (corresponding RR = 1.71, 95\% CI = 0.98 to 2.98; P(trend) =.04). Total carbohydrate (adjusted RR = 2.41, 95\% CI = 1.10 to 5.27, comparing extreme quintiles of carbohydrate; P(trend) =.02), nonfiber carbohydrate (corresponding RR = 2.60, 95\% CI = 1.22 to 5.54; P(trend) =.02), and fructose (corresponding RR = 2.09, 95\% CI = 1.13 to 3.87; P(trend) =.08) were also statistically significantly associated with increased risk. Thus, our data indicate that a diet with a high dietary glycemic load may increase the risk of colorectal cancer in women.},

	abstract = {A carbohydrate-rich diet, resulting in high blood glucose and insulin, has been hypothesized as involved in colorectal cancer etiology. We investigated dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), in relation to colorectal cancer, in the prospectively recruited EPIC-Italy cohort. After a median 11.7 years, 421 colorectal cancers were diagnosed among 47,749 recruited adults. GI and GL were estimated from validated food frequency questionnaires. Multivariable Cox modeling estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for associations between colorectal cancer and intakes of total, high GI and low GI carbohydrate and GI and GL. The adjusted HR of colorectal cancer for highest versus lowest GI quartile was 1.35; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.78; p trend 0.031. Increasing high GI carbohydrate intake was also significantly associated with increasing colorectal cancer risk (HR 1.45; 95\% CI 1.04-2.03; p trend 0.034), whereas increasing low GI carbohydrate was associated with reducing risk (HR 0.73; 95\% CI 0.54-0.98; p trend 0.033). High dietary GI and high GI carbohydrate were associated with increased risks of cancer at all colon sites (HR 1.37; 95\% CI 1.00-1.88, HR 1.80; 95\% CI 1.22-2.65, respectively), whereas high GI carbohydrate and high GL were associated with increased risk of proximal colon cancer (HR 1.94; 95\% CI 1.18-3.16, HR 2.01; 95\% CI 1.08-3.74, respectively). After stratification for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), cancer was significantly associated with GI, and high GI carbohydrate, in those with high WHR. These findings suggest that high dietary GI and high carbohydrate intake from high GI foods are associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses explaining the relationship between carbohydrate quality and health have usually examined a single marker and a limited number of clinical outcomes. We aimed to more precisely quantify the predictive potential of several markers, to determine which markers are most useful, and to establish an evidence base for quantitative recommendations for intakes of dietary fibre.
METHODS: We did a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies published from database inception to April 30, 2017, and randomised controlled trials published from database inception to Feb 28, 2018, which reported on indicators of carbohydrate quality and non-communicable disease incidence, mortality, and risk factors. Studies were identified by searches in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and by hand searching of previous publications. We excluded prospective studies and trials reporting on participants with a chronic disease, and weight loss trials or trials involving supplements. Searches, data extraction, and bias assessment were duplicated independently. Robustness of pooled estimates from random-effects models was considered with sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, dose-response testing, and subgroup analyses. The GRADE approach was used to assess quality of evidence.
FINDINGS: Just under 135 million person-years of data from 185 prospective studies and 58 clinical trials with 4635 adult participants were included in the analyses. Observational data suggest a 15-30\% decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality, and incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke incidence and mortality, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer when comparing the highest dietary fibre consumers with the lowest consumers Clinical trials show significantly lower bodyweight, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol when comparing higher with lower intakes of dietary fibre. Risk reduction associated with a range of critical outcomes was greatest when daily intake of dietary fibre was between 25 g and 29 g. Dose-response curves suggested that higher intakes of dietary fibre could confer even greater benefit to protect against cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal and breast cancer. Similar findings for whole grain intake were observed. Smaller or no risk reductions were found with the observational data when comparing the effects of diets characterised by low rather than higher glycaemic index or load. The certainty of evidence for relationships between carbohydrate quality and critical outcomes was graded as moderate for dietary fibre, low to moderate for whole grains, and low to very low for dietary glycaemic index and glycaemic load. Data relating to other dietary exposures are scarce.
INTERPRETATION: Findings from prospective studies and clinical trials associated with relatively high intakes of dietary fibre and whole grains were complementary, and striking dose-response evidence indicates that the relationships to several non-communicable diseases could be causal. Implementation of recommendations to increase dietary fibre intake and to replace refined grains with whole grains is expected to benefit human health. A major strength of the study was the ability to examine key indicators of carbohydrate quality in relation to a range of non-communicable disease outcomes from cohort studies and randomised trials in a single study. Our findings are limited to risk reduction in the population at large rather than those with chronic disease.

	issn = {0008-5472},
	abstract = {Laboratory and clinical data indicate an antitumor effect of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) on prostate cancer. High calcium intake suppresses formation of 1,25(OH)2D from 25(OH)D, thereby decreasing the 1,25(OH)2D level. Ingestion of fructose reduces plasma phosphate transiently, and hypophosphatemia stimulates 1,25(OH)2D production. We thus conducted a prospective study among 47,781 men of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study free of cancer in 1986 to examine whether calcium and fructose intake influenced risk of prostate cancer. Between 1986 and 1994, 1369 non-stage A1 and 423 advanced (extraprostatic) cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed. Higher consumption of calcium was related to advanced prostate cancer [multivariate relative risk (RR), 2.97; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.61-5.50 for intakes {\textgreater} or = 2000 mg/day versus {\textless} 500 mg/day; P, trend, 0.002] and metastatic prostate cancer (RR, 4.57; CI, 1.88-11.1; P, trend, {\textless}0.001). Calcium from food sources and from supplements independently increased risk. High fructose intake was related to a lower risk of advanced prostate cancer (multivariate RR, 0.51; CI, 0.33-0.80, for intakes {\textgreater} 70 versus {\textless} or = 40 g/day; P, trend, 0.007). Fruit intake was inversely associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer (RR, 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.43-0.93; for {\textgreater} 5 versus {\textless} or = 1 serving per day), and this association was accounted for by fructose intake. Non-fruit sources of fructose similarly predicted lower risk of advanced prostate cancer. A moderate positive association between energy-adjusted fat intake and advanced prostate cancer was attenuated and no longer statistically significant when controlled for calcium and fructose. Our findings provide indirect evidence for a protective influence of high 1,25(OH)2D levels on prostate cancer and support increased fruit consumption and avoidance of high calcium intake to reduce the risk of advanced prostate cancer.},

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the associations between dietary intakes of carbohydrates, fiber, and their food sources and risk of prostate cancer, overall and by case severity, in the Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort.
DESIGN: The analysis included 8128 men aged 45-73 y without a history of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes and who were classified as adequate energy reporters. After a median follow-up time of 15 y, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 817 men. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to model associations between energy-adjusted nutrient and food intakes with risk of incident prostate cancer, with competing risk of death from non-prostate cancer causes taken into account.
RESULTS: After adjustment for age and other known or potential risk factors, we observed no associations between total carbohydrates or dietary fiber and prostate cancer. We observed positive associations between the intake of low-fiber cereals with overall and low-risk prostate cancer and between intakes of cake and biscuits and rice and pasta with low-risk prostate cancer (all P-trend {\textless} 0.05). A high intake compared with zero consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with increased risk of symptomatic prostate cancer (HR: 1.38; 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.84).
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this large study with high-validity dietary data suggest that a high intake of refined carbohydrates may be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. However we observed no significant associations with high-risk prostate cancer, and not all foods that are typically high in refined carbohydrates were associated with prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading cause cancer among men worldwide. Many epidemiologic studies have reported an association between carbohydrate intake and PCa. However, the evidence from epidemiologic studies is inconsistent. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to explore the associations between carbohydrate intake and PCa risk and to investigate potential dose-response relationships.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies published from 1980 to 2018. 21 studies were included with 98,739 participants and 11,573 cases. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using random-effect models. Potential dose-response relationships were evaluated for PCa risk.
RESULTS: We did not detect an association about higher carbohydrate intake and PCa risk (OR:1.11, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-1. 26, I2 = 62.7\%), nor association was detected about higher carbohydrate intake with advanced PCa risk (OR:0.95, 95\% CI: 0.78-1.16, I2 = 14.1\%) or non-advanced Pca risk (OR:1.01, 95\% CI: 0.79-1.29, I2 = 64.4\%).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inconsistent findings from observational studies have prolonged the controversy over the effects of dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) on the risk of certain chronic diseases.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the association between GI, GL, and chronic disease risk with the use of meta-analysis techniques.
DESIGN: A systematic review of published reports identified a total of 37 prospective cohort studies of GI and GL and chronic disease risk. Studies were stratified further according to the validity of the tools used to assess dietary intake. Rate ratios (RRs) were estimated in a Cox proportional hazards model and combined by using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: From 4 to 20 y of follow-up across studies, a total of 40 129 incident cases were identified. For the comparison between the highest and lowest quantiles of GI and GL, significant positive associations were found in fully adjusted models of validated studies for type 2 diabetes (GI RR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.23, 1.59; GL RR = 1.27, 95\% CI: 1.12, 1.45), coronary heart disease (GI RR = 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.56), gallbladder disease (GI RR = 1.26, 95\% CI: 1.13, 1.40; GL RR = 1.41, 95\% CI: 1.25, 1.60), breast cancer (GI RR = 1.08, 95\% CI: 1.02, 1.16), and all diseases combined (GI RR = 1.14, 95\% CI: 1.09, 1.19; GL RR = 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.15).
CONCLUSIONS: Low-GI and/or low-GL diets are independently associated with a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases. In diabetes and heart disease, the protection is comparable with that seen for whole grain and high fiber intakes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that plasma insulin levels might influence ovarian cancer risk. Glycaemic index (GI) and glycaemic load (GL) are measures that allow the carbohydrate content of individual foods to be classified according to their postprandial glycaemic effects and hence their effects on circulating insulin levels. Therefore, we examined ovarian cancer risk in association with GI and GL, and intake of dietary carbohydrate and sugar.
METHODS: The study was conducted in a prospective cohort of 49 613 Canadian women enrolled in the National Breast Screening Study (NBSS) who completed a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) between 1980 and 1985. Linkages to national mortality and cancer databases yielded data on deaths and cancer incidence, with follow-up ending between 1998 and 2000. Data from the FFQ were used to estimate overall GI and GL, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between energy-adjusted quartile levels of GL, overall GI, total carbohydrates, total sugar and ovarian cancer risk.
RESULTS: During a mean 16.4 years of follow-up, we observed 264 incident ovarian cancer cases. GI and total carbohydrate and sugar intakes were not associated with ovarian cancer risk in the total cohort. GL was positively associated with a 72\% increase in risk of ovarian cancer (HR=1.72, 95\% CI=1.13-2.62, Ptrend=0.01) and the magnitude of the association was slightly greater among postmenopausal (HR=1.89, 95\% CI=0.98-3.65, Ptrend=0.03) than among premenopausal women (HR=1.64, 95\% CI=0.95-2.88, Ptrend=0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that consumption of diets with high GL values may be associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the commonest form of cancer in women worldwide. It has been suggested that chronic hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance plays a role in breast cancer etiology. To test the hyperinsulinemia hypothesis, a dietary pattern associated with a high glycemic index and glycemic load, both proxies for chronic hyperinsulinemia, should be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. A meta-analysis restricted to prospective cohort studies was undertaken using a random effects model with tests for statistical significance, publication bias and heterogeneity. The metric for analysis was the risk of breast cancer in the highest relative to the lowest glycemic index and glycemic load dietary pattern. A dietary pattern with a high glycemic index was associated with a summary relative risk (SRR) of 1.05 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.11), and a high glycemic load with a SRR of 1.06 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.13). Adjustments for body mass index [BMI], physical activity and other lifestyle factors did not influence the SRR, nor did menopausal status and estrogen receptor status of the tumor. In conclusion, the current evidence supports a modest association between a dietary pattern with high glycemic index or glycemic load and the risk of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Context: The investigation of dose-response associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, glycemic load, and risk of breast cancer stratified by menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and body mass index (BMI) remains inconclusive.
Objective: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analyses was conducted to investigate these associations.
Data Sources: As part of the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Continuous Update Project, PubMed was searched up to May 2015 for relevant studies on these associations.
Study Selection: Prospective studies reporting associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, or glycemic load and breast cancer risk were included.
Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data from included studies.
Results: Random-effects models were used to summarize relative risks (RRs) and 95\%CIs. Heterogeneity between subgroups, including menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and BMI was explored using meta-regression. Nineteen publications were included. The summary RRs (95\%CIs) for breast cancer were 1.04 (1.00-1.07) per 10 units/d for glycemic index, 1.01 (0.98-1.04) per 50 units/d for glycemic load, and 1.00 (0.96-1.05) per 50 g/d for carbohydrate intake. For glycemic index, the association appeared slightly stronger among postmenopausal women (summary RR per 10 units/d, 1.06; 95\%CI, 1.02-1.10) than among premenopausal women, though the difference was not statistically significant (Pheterogeneity = 0.15). Glycemic load and carbohydrate intake were positively associated with breast cancer among postmenopausal women with estrogen-negative tumors (summary RR for glycemic load, 1.28; 95\%CI, 1.08-1.52; and summary RR for carbohydrates, 1.13; 95\%CI, 1.02-1.25). No differences in BMI were detected.
Conclusions: Menopausal and hormone receptor status, but not BMI, might be potential influencing factors for the associations between carbohydrate intake, glycemic index, glycemic load, and breast cancer.},

The associations between GI and GL were not modified by body mass index (BMI) or by vigorous physical activity among pre- or postmenopausal women. Similarly, the associations between GI/GL and risk in postmenopausal women were not modified by BMI, vigorous physical activity, or ever use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), although the associations were slightly stronger among those who reported no vigorous physical activity (ptrend = 0.02), among those who reported ever using HRT (ptrend = 0.02) and among normal-weight women (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m2; ptrend = 0.03). Our data suggest that consumption of diets with high GI values may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women, possibly more so among subgroups defined by participation in vigorous physical activity, ever use of HRT and those who are not overweight.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: High-glycaemic-load diets may increase endometrial cancer risk by increasing circulating insulin levels and, as a consequence, circulating oestrogen levels. Given the paucity of epidemiological data regarding the relationship between dietary glycaemic index and glycaemic load and endometrial cancer risk, we sought to examine these associations using data from a prospective cohort study.
DESIGN, SETTING AND SUBJECTS: We examined the association between dietary glycaemic load and endometrial cancer risk in a cohort of 49,613 Canadian women aged between 40 and 59 years at baseline who completed self-administered food-frequency questionnaires between 1982 and 1985. Linkages to national mortality and cancer databases yielded data on deaths and cancer incidence, with follow-up ending between 1998 and 2000.
RESULTS: During a mean of 16.4 years of follow-up, we observed 426 incident cases of endometrial cancer. Hazard ratios for the highest versus the lowest quartile level of overall glycaemic index and glycaemic load were 1.47 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.90-2.41; P for trend = 0.14) and 1.36 (95\% CI = 1.01-1.84; P for trend = 0.21), respectively. No association was observed between total carbohydrate or total sugar consumption and endometrial cancer risk. Among obese women (body mass index {\textgreater}30 kg m(-2)) the hazard ratio for the highest versus the lowest quartile level of glycaemic load was 1.88 (95\% CI = 1.08-3.29; P for trend = 0.54) and there was a 55\% increased risk for the highest versus the lowest quartile level of glycaemic load among premenopausal women. There was also evidence to support a positive association between glycaemic load and endometrial cancer risk among postmenopausal women who had used hormone replacement therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that diets with high glycaemic index or high glycaemic load may be associated with endometrial cancer risk overall, and particularly among obese women, premenopausal women and postmenopausal women who use hormone replacement therapy.},

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) in multivariable models adjusted for confounding factors pertinent to individual cancers. We identified 29,099 cancer cases in men and 13,355 cases in women. In gender-combined analyses, added sugars were positively associated with risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR(Q5 vs. Q1) : 1.62, 95\% CI: 1.07-2.45; p(trend)  = 0.01), added fructose was associated with risk of small intestine cancer (HR(Q5 vs. Q1) : 2.20, 95\% CI: 1.16-4.16; p(trend)  = 0.009) and all investigated sugars were associated with increased risk of pleural cancer. In women, all investigated sugars were inversely associated with ovarian cancer. We found no association between dietary sugars and risk of colorectal or any other major cancer. Measurement error in FFQ-reported dietary sugars may have limited our ability to obtain more conclusive findings.

	abstract = {Low fecal weight and slow bowel transit time are thought to be associated with bowel cancer risk, but few published data defining bowel habits in different communities exist. Therefore, data on stool weight were collected from 20 populations in 12 countries to define this risk more accurately, and the relationship between stool weight and dietary intake of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) (dietary fiber) was quantified. In 220 healthy U.K. adults undertaking careful fecal collections, median daily stool weight was 106 g/day (men, 104 g/day; women, 99 g/day; P = 0.02) and whole-gut transit time was 60 hours (men, 55 hours; women, 72 hours; P = 0.05); 17\% of women, but only 1\% of men, passed {\textless} 50 g stool/day. Data from other populations of the world show average stool weight to vary from 72 to 470 g/day and to be inversely related to colon cancer risk (r = -0.78). Meta-analysis of 11 studies in which daily fecal weight was measured accurately in 26 groups of people (n = 206) on controlled diets of known NSP content shows a significant correlation between fiber intake and mean daily stool weight (r = 0.84). Stool weight in many Westernized populations is low (80-120 g/day), and this is associated with increased colon cancer risk. Fecal output is increased by dietary NSP. Diets characterized by high NSP intake (approximately 18 g/day) are associated with stool weights of 150 g/day and should reduce the risk of bowel cancer.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer is one of the so-called westernized diseases and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. On the basis of global epidemiological and scientific studies, evidence suggests that the risk of colorectal cancer is increased by processed and unprocessed meat consumption but suppressed by fibre, and that food composition affects colonic health and cancer risk via its effects on colonic microbial metabolism. The gut microbiota can ferment complex dietary residues that are resistant to digestion by enteric enzymes. This process provides energy for the microbiota but culminates in the release of short-chain fatty acids including butyrate, which are utilized for the metabolic needs of the colon and the body. Butyrate has a remarkable array of colonic health-promoting and antineoplastic properties: it is the preferred energy source for colonocytes, it maintains mucosal integrity and it suppresses inflammation and carcinogenesis through effects on immunity, gene expression and epigenetic modulation. Protein residues and fat-stimulated bile acids are also metabolized by the microbiota to inflammatory and/or carcinogenic metabolites, which increase the risk of neoplastic progression. This Review will discuss the mechanisms behind these microbial metabolite effects, which could be modified by diet to achieve the objective of preventing colorectal cancer in Western societies.},

	abstract = {Long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gut, but it remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change. Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Inconsistent findings from observational studies have continued the controversy over the effects of dietary fiber on colorectal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between dietary fiber intake and risk of colorectal cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From 13 prospective cohort studies included in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer, 725,628 men and women were followed up for 6 to 20 years across studies. Study- and sex-specific relative risks (RRs) were estimated with the Cox proportional hazards model and were subsequently pooled using a random-effects model.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident colorectal cancer.
RESULTS: During 6 to 20 years of follow-up across studies, 8081 colorectal cancer cases were identified. For comparison of the highest vs lowest study- and sex-specific quintile of dietary fiber intake, a significant inverse association was found in the age-adjusted model (pooled RR = 0.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.92). However, the association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjusting for other risk factors (pooled multivariate RR = 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.86-1.03). In categorical analyses compared with dietary fiber intake of 10 to {\textless}15 g/d, the pooled multivariate RR was 1.18 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.31) for less than 10 g/d (11\% of the overall study population); and RR, 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.85-1.17) for 30 or more g/d. Fiber intake from cereals, fruits, and vegetables was not associated with risk of colorectal cancer. The pooled multivariate RRs comparing the highest vs lowest study- and sex-specific quintile of dietary fiber intake were 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.90-1.11) for colon cancer and 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.72-1.01) for rectal cancer (P for common effects by tumor site = .07).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large pooled analysis, dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with risk of colorectal cancer in age-adjusted analyses. However, after accounting for other dietary risk factors, high dietary fiber intake was not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of dietary fiber with colorectal cancer
METHODS: A total of 85,903 men and 105,108 women completed a quantitative food frequency questionnaire in 1993-1996. A total of 1,138 men and 972 women were subsequently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the large bowel. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate multivariate adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) for colorectal cancer.
RESULTS: High consumers of dietary fiber were more active, less overweight, and less likely to be cigarette smokers than low consumers in both sexes. Fiber was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk after adjustment for age and ethnicity in men (RR = 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.41-0.60, highest vs. lowest quintile) and women (RR = 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.61-0.92). After further adjustment for lifestyle and dietary factors, the inverse association remained significant in men (RR = 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.48-0.79), but not in women (RR = 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.67-1.14). Adjustment for the combination of replacement hormone use with either cigarette smoking or body mass index accounted for the lack of association with fiber in women.
CONCLUSION: Dietary fiber was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in men, but its relation to replacement hormone use and other factors affected its inverse association in women.},

In women, the inverse relationship was weaker and appeared to be confounded by menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). We re-examined this observation with a greatly increased power. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we analyzed data from 187,674 participants with 4,692 cases identified during a mean follow-up period of 16 years. In multivariable-adjusted models, dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in both sexes: HR = 0.73, 95\% CI: 0.61-0.89 for highest vs. lowest quintile, ptrend  = 0.0020 in men and HR = 0.76, 95\% CI: 0.62-0.91, ptrend  = 0.0067 in women. Postmenopausal women who ever used MHT had a 19\% lower risk of colorectal cancer (95\% CI: 0.74-0.89) compared with MHT never users. In a joint analysis of dietary fiber and MHT, dietary fiber intake was associated with a lower colorectal cancer risk in MHT never users (HR = 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.59-0.95, ptrend  = 0.045), but did not appear to further decrease the colorectal cancer risk of MHT ever users (ptrend  = 0.11). Our results support the overall protective roles of dietary fiber and MHT against colorectal cancer and suggest that dietary fiber may not lower risk further among women who ever used MHT. If confirmed, these results would suggest that MHT and dietary fiber may share overlapping mechanisms in protecting against colorectal cancer.},

The purpose of this article is to summarize the findings published thus far from the EPIC study on the associations between fruit, vegetable, or fiber consumption and the risk of cancer at 14 different sites. The risk of cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract was inversely associated with fruit intake but was not associated with vegetable intake. The risk of colorectal cancer was inversely associated with intakes of total fruit and vegetables and total fiber, and the risk of liver cancer was also inversely associated with the intake of total fiber. The risk of cancer of the lung was inversely associated with fruit intake but was not associated with vegetable intake; this association with fruit intake was restricted to smokers and might be influenced by residual confounding due to smoking. There was a borderline inverse association of fiber intake with breast cancer risk. For the other 9 cancer sites studied (stomach, biliary tract, pancreas, cervix, endometrium, prostate, kidney, bladder, and lymphoma) there were no reported significant associations of risk with intakes of total fruit, vegetables, or fiber.},

We searched the reference lists of the studies included in our analysis as well as those listed in the published meta-analyses. A random-effects model was used to compute summary risk estimates.

All statistical tests were 2-sided.We identified and included 11 prospective cohort studies in the final meta-analysis. The risks of PCC and DCC among individuals in the highest dietary fiber intake quartile/quintile were 14\% (relative risk [RR] = 0.86, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.78-0.95) and 21\% (RR = 0.79, 95\% CI = 0.71-0.87) lower, respectively, than those among individuals with the lowest dietary fiber intake. In a subgroup analysis, the inverse association observed in the sex-based subgroup was apparent only for men with PCC. Dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with DCC for both men and women. In addition, dietary fiber intake appeared to be inversely associated with PCC only in European countries, whereas this association was observed for DCC in both European countries and the United States.Our findings reveal that dietary fiber intake is associated inversely with the risk of both PCC and DCCs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is suggestive evidence that increased intake of dietary fibre and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are generally associated with decreased colorectal cancer risk. However, the effects on precursors of colorectal cancer, such as adenomatous polyps, are mixed. We present the associations between dietary fibre intake and NSAID use on the presence and type of colorectal polyps in a screening population.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 2548 individuals undergoing colonoscopy at the Forzani \& MacPhail Colon Cancer Screening Centre (Calgary, Canada) was conducted. Dietary fibre intake and NSAID use were assessed using the Diet History Questionnaire I or II and the Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire. Colorectal outcomes were documented as a polyp or high-risk adenomatous polyp (HRAP; villous histology, high-grade dysplasia, ≥10 mm or ≥3 adenomas). Crude and ORs and 95\% CIs were estimated using unconditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: There were 1450 negative colonoscopies and 1098 patients with polyps, of which 189 patients had HRAPs. Total dietary fibre intake was associated with a decreased presence of HRAPs (OR=0.50, 95\% CI: 0.29 to 0.86) when comparing the highest to lowest quartiles and was observed with both soluble (OR=0.51, 95\% CI: 0.30 to 0.88) and insoluble (OR=0.51, 95\% CI: 0.30 to 0.86) fibres. Ever use of NSAIDs was also inversely associated with HRAPs (OR=0.65, 95\% CI: 0.47 to 0.89), observed with monthly (OR=0.60, 95\% CI: 0.37 to 0.95) and daily (OR=0.53, 95\% CI: 0.32 to 0.86) use.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fibre intake and NSAID use were associated with a decreased risk of having a HRAP at screening.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that men with elevated plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) may have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Furthermore, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and insulin can modulate the activity of IGF-I. In this study, we sought to determine the role of IGF-I as well as IGFBPs-1, -2, and -3 and insulin as possible etiologic factors for prostate cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort Study. We measured levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, and insulin in plasma samples from 149 men who had a diagnosis of prostate cancer between 1 month and 10 years after blood collection and among 298 control men. All statistical tests are two-sided.
RESULTS: Case subjects had statistically significantly higher mean levels of IGF-I than control subjects (229 ng/mL; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 218-240 ng/mL] versus 214 ng/mL [95\% CI = 208-221 ng/mL]; P =.02) and IGFBP-3 (2611 ng/mL [95\% CI = 2518-2704 ng/mL] versus 2498 ng/mL [95\% CI = 2437-2560 ng/mL]; P =.04). Conditional logistic regression analyses showed increases in prostate cancer risk with rising levels of IGF-I (P:(for trend) =.02) and IGFBP-3 (P(for trend) =.03). In case subjects younger than 59 years at the time of blood collection, the risk associated with increased IGF-I was higher (P:(for trend) =.01), whereas the risk associated with increased IGFBP-3 was lower (P(for trend) =.44) than the corresponding risks in the full cohort. Prostate cancer risk was not associated with levels of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, or insulin.
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer risk is increased in men with elevated plasma IGF-I. This association was particularly strong in younger men in this study, suggesting that circulating IGF-I may be specifically involved in the early pathogenesis of prostate cancer.},

	abstract = {Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have potent mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects on prostate epithelial cells. Through modulation of IGF bioactivity and other mechanisms, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) also have growth-regulatory effects on prostate cells. Recently, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 have been implicated in prostate cancer risk among Western populations. To assess whether IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, or IGFBP-3 are also associated with prostate cancer in a low-risk population, we measured plasma levels of these factors among 128 newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases and 306 randomly selected population controls in Shanghai, China. Relative to the lowest quartile of IGF-I levels, men in the highest quartile had a 2.6-fold higher prostate cancer risk, with a significant trend [odds ratio (OR) = 2.63; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.19-5.79; P(trend) = 0.01]. In contrast, men in the highest quartile of IGFBP-3 levels had a 46\% decreased risk relative to the lowest quartile (OR = 0.54; 95\% CI = 0.26-1.15; P(trend) = 0.08). A similar but less distinct result was observed for IGFBP-1 (OR = 0.60; 95\% CI = 0.31-1.17; P(trend) = 0.25). Men in the highest quartile for the IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratio (an indirect measure of free IGF-I) had a 2.5-fold higher risk compared with the lowest quartile (OR = 2.51; 95\% CI = 1.32-4.75, P(trend) {\textless} 0.001). These associations were more pronounced after adjustment for serum 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol glucuronide and sex hormone-binding globulin levels. There was no significant association with IGF-II levels. Our findings in a low-risk population provide evidence that IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-1 are determinants of prostate cancer and indicate that additional studies are needed to evaluate their effects on ethnic and geographic incidence differentials and to elucidate carcinogenic mechanisms.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We extended our previous case-control study nested in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort, a population-based cohort from a region where little prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening is done. Levels of IGF-I and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were measured in prediagnostic blood samples from a total of 281 men who were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer after recruitment (median, 5 years after blood collection) and from 560 matched controls.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed increases in prostate cancer risk with increasing plasma peptide levels, up to an odds ratio (OR) for top versus bottom quartile of IGF-I of 1.67 (95\% CI, 1.02 to 2.71; Ptrend = .05), which was attenuated after adjustment for IGFBP-3 to an OR of 1.47 (95\% CI, 0.81 to 2.64; P (trend) =.32). For men younger than 59 years at recruitment, OR for top versus bottom quartile of IGF-I was 4.12 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 16.70; Ptrend = .002), which was significantly stronger than for men older than 59 years (P (interaction) = .006). For men with advanced cancer, OR for top versus bottom quartile of IGF-I was 2.87 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 8.12; Ptrend = .10).
CONCLUSION: Our data add further support for IGF-I as an etiologic factor in prostate cancer and indicate that circulating IGF-I levels measured at a comparatively young age may be most strongly associated with prostate cancer risk.},

	abstract = {A diet high in fat has been linked to prostate cancer, possibly through an influence on hormones. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) binds androgens and is regulated in part by insulin. Diet and exercise can modify insulin levels, potentially affecting SHBG and the biologically available levels of androgens. To determine the effects of a low-fat ({\textless} 10\% of calories), high-fiber diet plus daily exercise on insulin, SHBG, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and serum lipids, we measured the levels of these factors in the serum of 27 obese men undergoing a three-week diet-and-exercise program. Insulin decreased from 222 +/- 30 to 126 +/- 21 pmol/l (p {\textless} 0.01), and SHBG increased from 18 +/- 2 to 25 +/- 3 nmol/l (p {\textless} 0.01). Body mass index decreased from 35 +/- 1.9 to 33.4 +/- 1.8 kg/m2 (p {\textless} 0.01). PSA levels were normal and did not change significantly, although in a small subset of men (n = 3) with slightly elevated PSA levels ({\textgreater} 2.5 ng/ml) all showed a decrease. The three-week diet-and-exercise intervention decreased insulin and lipid levels while increasing SHBG. The increase in SHBG would result in more testosterone being bound and, therefore, less of the androgen available to act on the prostate. The decrease in insulin might also decrease mitogenic activity in the prostate. The diet-and-exercise regimen did not have a significant impact on normal PSA levels. Although modest, these changes may be protective against the development of prostate cancer.},

METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by PubMed (1966 to March 2015) and Embase (1974 to March 2015) database search through March 2015. We included epidemiological studies that reported relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between dietary fiber intake and prostate cancer risk. Random effects models were used to calculate the summary risk estimates.
RESULTS: For the highest compared with the lowest dietary fiber intake, a significantly decreased risk with prostate cancer was observed in case-control studies (OR = 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.96), but not in cohort studies (RR = 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.77-1.11). The combined risk estimate of all studies was 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.77, 1.01). A significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (p = 0.005). There was no evidence of significant publication bias based on Begg's funnel plot (p = 0.753) or Egger's test (p = 0.946).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses explaining the relationship between carbohydrate quality and health have usually examined a single marker and a limited number of clinical outcomes. We aimed to more precisely quantify the predictive potential of several markers, to determine which markers are most useful, and to establish an evidence base for quantitative recommendations for intakes of dietary fibre.
METHODS: We did a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective studies published from database inception to April 30, 2017, and randomised controlled trials published from database inception to Feb 28, 2018, which reported on indicators of carbohydrate quality and non-communicable disease incidence, mortality, and risk factors. Studies were identified by searches in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and by hand searching of previous publications. We excluded prospective studies and trials reporting on participants with a chronic disease, and weight loss trials or trials involving supplements. Searches, data extraction, and bias assessment were duplicated independently. Robustness of pooled estimates from random-effects models was considered with sensitivity analyses, meta-regression, dose-response testing, and subgroup analyses. The GRADE approach was used to assess quality of evidence.
FINDINGS: Just under 135 million person-years of data from 185 prospective studies and 58 clinical trials with 4635 adult participants were included in the analyses. Observational data suggest a 15-30\% decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular related mortality, and incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke incidence and mortality, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer when comparing the highest dietary fibre consumers with the lowest consumers Clinical trials show significantly lower bodyweight, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol when comparing higher with lower intakes of dietary fibre. Risk reduction associated with a range of critical outcomes was greatest when daily intake of dietary fibre was between 25 g and 29 g. Dose-response curves suggested that higher intakes of dietary fibre could confer even greater benefit to protect against cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal and breast cancer. Similar findings for whole grain intake were observed. Smaller or no risk reductions were found with the observational data when comparing the effects of diets characterised by low rather than higher glycaemic index or load. The certainty of evidence for relationships between carbohydrate quality and critical outcomes was graded as moderate for dietary fibre, low to moderate for whole grains, and low to very low for dietary glycaemic index and glycaemic load. Data relating to other dietary exposures are scarce.
INTERPRETATION: Findings from prospective studies and clinical trials associated with relatively high intakes of dietary fibre and whole grains were complementary, and striking dose-response evidence indicates that the relationships to several non-communicable diseases could be causal. Implementation of recommendations to increase dietary fibre intake and to replace refined grains with whole grains is expected to benefit human health. A major strength of the study was the ability to examine key indicators of carbohydrate quality in relation to a range of non-communicable disease outcomes from cohort studies and randomised trials in a single study. Our findings are limited to risk reduction in the population at large rather than those with chronic disease.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A few papers have considered reproducibility of a posteriori dietary patterns across populations, as well as pattern associations with head and neck cancer risk when multiple populations are available.
METHODS: We used individual-level pooled data from seven case-control studies (3844 cases; 6824 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology consortium. We simultaneously derived shared and study-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-study factor analysis applied to 23 nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined, and larynx, from logistic regression models.
RESULTS: We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible across studies (75\% variance explained): the Antioxidant vitamins and fiber (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI = 0.41, 0.78, highest versus lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI = 0.67, 0.95) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk. The Animal products and cereals (OR = 1.5, 95\% CI = 1.1, 2.1) and the Fats (OR = 1.8, 95\% CI = 1.4, 2.3) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk, whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for the Antioxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additional study-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined. We named them all as Dairy products and breakfast cereals, and two were associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Multi-study factor analysis provides insight into pattern reproducibility and supports previous evidence on cross-country reproducibility of dietary patterns and on their association with head and neck cancer risk. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B430.},

METHODS: We used a case-control study which included 548 cases and 548 controls. From these participants, we derived 23 nutrients and they were then submitted to a factorability analysis in order to conduct a principal component factor analysis.
RESULTS: We were able to identify four nutrient-derived patterns. The first pattern (meat-based pattern) was positively associated with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (OR 2.85, 95 \% CI 1.81-4.15), whereas the third pattern (fruit-based) was strongly protective (OR 0.43, 95 \% CI 0.27-0.63). The other nutrient patterns were also significantly associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with minor ORs.
CONCLUSION: Both patterns suggest that red meat and fruits are major factors in the etiology of head and neck squamous cell cancer, replicating previous studies in the field.},

Nonetheless, inverse associations were consistently observed for the subsites of oral and pharyngeal cancers and within most strata of the considered covariates, for both cancer sites.

METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) to investigate dietary fiber and grain intake in relation to head and neck cancer.
RESULTS: During approximately 11 years of follow-up, 1,867 (401 women/1,466 men) cases of head and neck cancer were diagnosed. Our data indicated that the relationship between fiber and grain intake and head and neck cancer is modified by sex (p-interactions {\textless} 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Women with higher intake of total fiber and total grains had a lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR (10 g/day) = 0.77, 95\% CI = 0.64-0.93; HR (serving/1,000 kcal) = 0.89, 95\% CI = 0.80-0.99, respectively); this inverse relation was consistent across subtypes of fiber and grains. Conversely in men, the inverse associations were weaker and nonsignificant.

Data sources included MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, LILACS, and Wanfang. Eligible studies were comparative and reported any intervention with a different starch content of diets or foods and data on oral health outcomes relating to dental caries, periodontal disease, or oral cancer. Studies that reported total dietary starch intake or change in starch intake were included or where comparisons or exposure included diets and foods that compared RDSs and/or SDSs. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) statement, and evidence was assessed with the GRADE Working Group guidelines. From 6,080 papers identified, 33 (28 studies) were included in the RDS versus SDS comparison: 15 (14 studies) assessed the relationship between SDS and/or RDS and dental caries; 16 (12 studies) considered oral cancer; and 2 studied periodontal disease. For total starch, 23 papers (22 studies) were included: 22 assessed the effects on dental caries, and 1 considered oral cancer. GRADE assessment indicated low-quality evidence, suggesting no association between total starch intake and caries risk but that RDS intake may significantly increase caries risk. Very low-quality evidence suggested no association between total starch and oral cancer risk, and low-quality evidence suggested that SDS decreases oral cancer risk. Data on RDS and oral cancer risk were inconclusive. Very low-quality data relating to periodontitis suggested a protective effect of whole grain starches (SDS). The best available evidence suggests that only RDS adversely affects oral health.},

	abstract = {Importance: Although high dietary fiber intake has been associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), it remains unknown whether fiber benefits CRC survivors.
Objective: To assess the association of postdiagnostic fiber intake with mortality.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 1575 health care professionals with stage I to III CRC were evaluated in 2 prospective cohorts, Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Colorectal cancer-specific and overall mortality were determined after adjusting for other potential predictors for cancer survival. The study was conducted from December 23, 2016, to August 23, 2017.
Exposures: Consumption of total fiber and different sources of fiber and whole grains assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire between 6 months and 4 years after CRC diagnosis.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs of CRC-specific and overall mortality after adjusting for other potential predictors for cancer survival.
Results: Of the 1575 participants, 963 (61.1\%) were women; mean (SD) age was 68.6 (8.9) years. During a median of 8 years of follow-up, 773 deaths were documented, including 174 from CRC. High intake of total fiber after diagnosis was associated with lower mortality. The multivariable HR per each 5-g increment in intake per day was 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.65-0.93; P = .006) for CRC-specific mortality and 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.79-0.93; P {\textless} .001) for all-cause mortality. Patients who increased their fiber intake after diagnosis from levels before diagnosis had a lower mortality, and each 5-g/d increase in intake was associated with 18\% lower CRC-specific mortality (95\% CI, 7\%-28\%; P = .002) and 14\% lower all-cause mortality (95\% CI, 8\%-19\%; P {\textless} .001). According to the source of fiber, cereal fiber was associated with lower CRC-specific mortality (HR per 5-g/d increment, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.90; P = .007) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.90; P {\textless} .001); vegetable fiber was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.96; P = .009) but not CRC-specific mortality (HR, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.60-1.13; P = .22); no association was found for fruit fiber. Whole grain intake was associated with lower CRC-specific mortality (HR per 20-g/d increment, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.59-0.88; P = .002), and this beneficial association was attenuated after adjusting for fiber intake (HR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.96; P = .02).
Conclusions and Relevance: Higher fiber intake after the diagnosis of nonmetastatic CRC is associated with lower CRC-specific and overall mortality. Increasing fiber consumption after diagnosis may confer additional benefits to patients with CRC.},

We prospectively examined associations between pre- and post-treatment carbohydrate intake and recurrence, all-cause mortality, and HNSCC-specific mortality in a cohort of 414 newly diagnosed HNSCC patients. All participants completed pre- and post-treatment Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) and epidemiologic surveys. Recurrence and mortality events were collected annually. Multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards models tested associations between carbohydrate intake (categorized into low, medium and high intake) and time to recurrence and mortality, adjusting for relevant covariates.

In post-treatment analyses, medium fat intake was significantly associated with reduced risk of recurrence (HR 0.08; 95\% CI 0.01-0.69) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.27; 95\% CI 0.07-0.96). Stratification by tumor site and cancer stage in pretreatment analyses suggested effect modification by these factors. Our data suggest high pretreatment carbohydrate intake may be associated with adverse prognosis in HNSCC patients. Clinical intervention trials to further examine this hypothesis are warranted.},

DESIGN: Randomized, crossover design.
SETTING: Academic research center.
PATIENT(S): Fifteen women with PCOS.
INTERVENTION(S): We evaluated changes in T, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), DHEAS, cortisol, glucose, and insulin for 6 hours after a high-fat, Western meal (HIFAT) (62\% fat, 24\% carbohydrate, 1 g fiber) and an isocaloric low-fat, high-fiber meal (HIFIB) (6\% fat, 81\% carbohydrate, 27 g fiber).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Change in T levels.
RESULT(S): Testosterone decreased 27\% within 2 hours after both meals. However, T remained below premeal values for 4 hours after the HIFIB meal and 6 hours after the HIFAT meal. Insulin was twofold higher for 2 hours after the HIFIB meal compared with the HIFAT meal. Glucose was higher for 1 hour after the HIFIB meal compared with the HIFAT meal. DHEAS decreased 8\%-10\% within 2-3 hours after both meals, then increased during the remainder of the study period. Cortisol decreased during the 6-hour period after both meals.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet plays a role in the regulation of T levels in women with PCOS. Further studies are needed to determine the role of diet composition in the treatment of PCOS.},

The present review focuses on intervention trials with three primary aims: (1) understanding the mechanisms through which fibre consumption improves health (for example, examination of intermediate endpoints reflecting improved lipid, glucose and energy metabolism); (2) close evaluation of qualitative factors which modify fibre's effectiveness including physiochemical properties (for example, solubility, fermentability and viscosity), fibre extract molecular weight, fibre particle size and botanical structure of the fibre source grain; and (3) identification of areas in which additional research is needed. The first two aims typify the goals of nutrition research, in that improved understanding of the specific factors which determine fibre's health benefits has critical implications for dietary recommendations as well as improving understanding of physiological mechanisms. The third aim acknowledges the substantial gap between recommended and actual fibre intakes in many developed countries including the USA and the UK. In recognition of this deficit in total fibre intake, food manufacturing processes increasingly utilise fibre extracts and concentrates as food additives. However, whether fibre extracts provide similar health benefits to the fibre supplied in the constituents of whole grain is largely unexplored. The relative benefits of fibre extracts compared with whole-grain fibre sources therefore represent a critical area in which additional research is needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is commonly affected by obesity. PCOS phenotypes are prone to increased waist/hip ratio, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. This substudy was undertaken to evaluate the effects of lifestyle interventions on metabolic biomarkers in overweight/obese PCOS women and the interventional effects of dietary components related to metabolic outcomes.
DESIGN: Randomized three-arm parallel study.
PATIENTS: Fifty-seven PCOS women body mass index (BMI {\textgreater}27 kg/m2 , age 18-40) were randomly assigned to diet (D, n = 19), exercise (E, n = 19) or diet plus exercise (DE, n = 19) in three-arm fashion over 16 weeks. The D group received nutritional counselling by a dietician to reduce their energy intake by at least 600 kcal/d. The E group received an ambulatory exercise regimen from a physiotherapist. The DE group had both interventions.
MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported food intake over 4 days, exercise pedometers, BMI, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure, body composition and oral glucose tolerance test were performed before and at the end of intervention.
RESULTS: BMI, waist circumference and total cholesterol were significantly reduced in the D and DE groups, as well as low-density lipoprotein and Homeostasis Model of Assessment index in the D group. In the E group, exercise was increased along with a decrease in BMI and waist circumference. The strongest predictor of reduced BMI was increased fibre intake (-0.44, P = .03), while a decrease in trans fatty acid intake predicted reduced insulinogenic index (0.44, P {\textless} .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional counselling with dieting is clearly effective to improve metabolic disturbances in overweight/obese women with PCOS. Increased fibre and reduced trans fatty acid intake are primary predictors of metabolic improvement and weight control.},

The actual cause of this syndrome is unknown but environmental factors such as dietary habits play an important role in prevention and treatment and lifestyle modifications are the most important therapeutic strategies in these patients. The approach of the diet therapy in these patients must be to reach specific goals such as improving insulin resistance, metabolic and reproductive functions that will be possible through the design of low-calorie diet to achieve weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight, limit the intake of simple sugars and refined carbohydrates and intake foods with a low glycemic index, reduction of saturated and trans fatty acids and attention to possible deficiencies such as vitamin D, chromium and omega-3. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity and insulin resistance, a relatively low reduction in weight, about 5\%, can improve problems such as insulin resistance, high levels of androgens, reproductive system dysfunctions and fertility in these women.},

The aim of the present study was to review the literature on the effects of LCD in PCOS, and to summarize the findings into evidence-based guidelines. A literature review based on publications in PubMed and Cochrane was carried out. The outcomes during LCD were compared to other types of diet interventions and exercise. Studies including insulin-sensitizing agents, such as metformin, were excluded. The outcomes were fertility, endocrine/metabolic parameters, weight loss and satiety. The review resulted in fifteen articles. Fertility parameters, endocrine hormones, metabolic outcomes and satiety hormones were not further improved during LCD compared to a standard diet. LCD had a 1-5\% significant additional effect on weight loss compared to a standard diet. Energy restriction and weight loss in PCOS improve ovulation rates, conception, hyperandrogenemia, glucose- and insulin levels, insulin resistance and satiety hormones, whereas diet composition is of less importance. A LCD has an additional effect to caloric restriction in terms of weight loss. Conclusions are summarized as evidence-based recommendations.},

DESIGN: This is a longitudinal study of changes of steroid hormones in 40 obese girls aged 13-16 years (50\% with PCOS) participating in a 1-year lifestyle intervention. Girls with and without PCOS were matched to age, BMI and change of weight status.
METHODS: We measured progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 17-hydroxyprogenolon, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 21-deoxycorticosterone, deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, cortisone, androstenedione, testosterone, dehydroepiandrostendione-sulfate (DHEA-S), estrone and estradiol by LC-MS/MS steroid profiling at baseline and one year later.
RESULTS: At baseline, obese PCOS girls demonstrated significantly higher androstenedione and testosterone concentrations compared to obese girls without PCOS, whereas the other steroid hormones including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, estrogens and precursors of androgens did not differ significantly. Weight loss in obese PCOS girls was associated with a significant decrease of testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA-S, cortisol and corticosterone concentrations. Weight loss in obese non-PCOS girls was associated with a significant decrease of DHEA-S, cortisol and corticosterone concentrations, whereas no significant changes of testosterone and androstenedione concentrations could be observed. Without weight loss, no significant changes of steroid hormones were measured except an increase of estradiol in obese PCOS girls without weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS: The key steroid hormones in obese adolescents with PCOS are androstenedione and testosterone, whereas glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, estrogens and precursors of androgens did not differ between obese girls with and without PCOS.},

There are emerging global data that women with PCOS have different baseline dietary energy intakes compared with women without PCOS. These alterations in diet may exacerbate clinical symptoms and compound risk of chronic disease in patients. Few studies have compared baseline physical activity levels between women with and without PCOS. Although comparisons between studies are confounded by several factors, the data point to no differences in activity levels among PCOS and non-PCOS groups. This review provides an assessment of the current literature on baseline dietary intake and physical activity levels in women with PCOS.

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What are the respective roles of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), long-term weight gain and obesity for the development of prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by age 46 years?
SUMMARY ANSWER: The risk of T2DM in women with PCOS is mainly due to overweight and obesity, although these two factors have a synergistic effect on the development of T2DM.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: PCOS is associated with an increased risk of prediabetes and T2DM. However, the respective roles of PCOS per se and BMI for the development of T2DM have remained unclear.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In a prospective, general population-based follow-up birth cohort 1966 (n = 5889), postal questionnaires were sent at ages 14 (95\% answered), 31 (80\% answered) and 46 years (72\% answered). Questions about oligoamenorrhoea and hirsutism were asked at age 31 years, and a question about PCOS diagnosis at 46 years. Clinical examination and blood sampling were performed at 31 years in 3127 women, and at 46 years in 3280 women. A 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at 46 years of age in 2780 women.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women reporting both oligoamenorrhoea and hirsutism at age 31 years and/or diagnosis of PCOS by 46 years were considered as women with PCOS (n = 279). Women without any symptoms at 31 years and without PCOS diagnosis by 46 years were considered as controls (n = 1577). The level of glucose metabolism was classified according to the results of the OGTT and previous information of glucose metabolism status from the national drug and hospital discharge registers.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: PCOS per se significantly increased the risk of T2DM in overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2) women with PCOS when compared to overweight/obese controls (odds ratio: 2.45, 95\% CI: 1.28-4.67). Normal weight women with PCOS did not present with an increased risk of prediabetes or T2DM. The increase in weight between ages 14, 31 and 46 years was significantly greater in women with PCOS developing T2DM than in women with PCOS and normal glucose tolerance, with the most significant increase occurring in early adulthood (between 14 and 31 years: median with [25\%; 75\% quartiles]: 27.25 kg [20.43; 34.78] versus 13.80 kg [8.55; 20.20], P {\textless} 0.001).
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The diagnosis of PCOS was based on self-reporting, and the questionnaire at 46 years did not distinguish between polycystic ovaries only in ultrasonography and the syndrome. Ovarian ultrasonography was not available to aid the diagnosis of PCOS.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These results emphasize weight management already during adolescence and early adulthood to prevent the development of T2DM in women with PCOS, as the period between 14 and 31 years seems to be a crucial time-window during which the women with PCOS who are destined to develop T2DM by 46 years of age experience a dramatic weight gain. Furthermore, our results support the view that, particularly in times of limited sources of healthcare systems, OGTT screening should be targeted to overweight/obese women with PCOS rather than to all women with PCOS.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Typically, management of PCOS focuses on lifestyle changes (exercise and diet), aiming to alleviate symptoms, and lower the associated risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to analyse evidence on the effectiveness of exercise in the management of PCOS, when compared to (i) usual care, (ii) diet alone, and (iii) exercise combined with diet, and also exercise combined with diet, compared to (i) control or usual care and (ii) diet alone.
METHODS: Relevant databases were searched (June 2017) with no time limit for trial inclusion. Eligible trials employed a randomised or quasi-randomised design to measure the chronic effects of exercise, or exercise and diet in women with PCOS.
RESULTS: Searches returned 2390 articles; of those, 27 papers from 18 trials were included. Results are presented as mean difference (MD) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Compared with control, exercise had a statistical effect on change from baseline fasting insulin (MD - 2.44 μIU/mL, 95\% CIs - 4.24 to - 0.64; very low-quality evidence), HOMA-IR (- 0.57, - 0.99 to - 0.14; very low-quality evidence), total cholesterol (- 5.88 mg/dL, - 9.92 to - 1.83; low-quality evidence), LDL cholesterol (- 7.39 mg/dL, - 9.83 to - 4.95; low-quality evidence), and triglycerides (- 4.78 mg/dL, - 7.52 to - 2.05; low-quality evidence). Exercise also improved VO2 max (3.84 ml/kg/min, 2.87 to 4.81), waist circumference (- 2.62 cm, - 4.13 to - 1.11), and body fat percentage (- 1.39\%, - 2.61 to - 0.18) when compared with usual care. No effect was found for change value systolic/diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol (all low-quality evidence), or waist-to-hip ratio. Many favourable change score findings were supported by post-intervention value analyses: fasting insulin (- 2.11 μIU/mL, - 3.49 to - 0.73), total cholesterol (- 6.66 mg/dL, - 11.14 to - 2.17), LDL cholesterol (- 6.91 mg/dL, - 12.02 to - 1.80), and VO2 max (5.01 ml/kg/min, 3.48 to 6.54). Statistically lower BMI (- 1.02 kg/m2, - 1.81 to - 0.23) and resting heart rate (- 3.26 beats/min - 4.93 to - 1.59) were also revealed in post-intervention analysis. Subgroup analyses revealed the greatest improvements in overweight/obese participants, and more outcomes improved when interventions were supervised, aerobic in nature, or of a shorter duration. Based on limited data, we found no differences for any outcome between the effects of exercise and diet combined, and diet alone. It was not possible to compare exercise vs diet or exercise and diet combined vs diet.
CONCLUSION: Statistically beneficial effects of exercise were found for a range of metabolic, anthropometric, and cardiorespiratory fitness-related outcomes. However, caution should be adopted when interpreting these findings since many outcomes present modest effects and wide CIs, and statistical effects in many analyses are sensitive to the addition/removal of individual trials. Future work should focus on rigorously designed, well-reported trials that make comparisons involving both exercise and diet.

Anovulation accounts for around 30\% of female infertility, and while lifestyle factors such as physical activity are known to be important, the relationship between exercise and ovulation is multi-factorial and complex, and to date there are no clear recommendations concerning exercise regimes.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to systematically assess the effect of physical activity on ovulation and to discuss the possible mechanisms by which exercise acts to modulate ovulation in reproductive-age women. This was done with a view to improve existing guidelines for women wishing to conceive, as well as women suffering from anovulatory infertility.
SEARCH METHODS: The published literature was searched up to April 2016 using the search terms ovulation, anovulatory, fertility, sport, physical activity and exercise. Both observational and interventional studies were considered, as well as studies that combined exercise with diet. Case studies and articles that did not report anovulation/ovulation or ovarian morphology as outcomes were excluded. Studies involving administered drugs in addition to exercise were excluded.
RESULTS: In total, ten interventions and four observational cohort studies were deemed relevant. Cohort studies showed that there is an increased risk of anovulation in extremely heavy exercisers ({\textgreater}60 min/day), but vigorous exercise of 30-60 min/day was associated with reduced risk of anovulatory infertility. Ten interventions were identified, and of these three have studied the effect of vigorous exercise on ovulation in healthy, ovulating women, but only one showed a significant disruption of ovulation as a result. Seven studies have investigated the effect of exercise on overweight/obese women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or anovulatory infertility, showing that exercise, with or without diet, can lead to resumption of ovulation. The mechanism by which exercise affects ovulation is most probably via modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis due to increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In heavy exercisers and/or underweight women, an energy drain, low leptin and fluctuating opioids caused by excess exercise have been implicated in HPA dysfunction. In overweight and obese women (with or without PCOS), exercise contributed to lower insulin and free androgen levels, leading to the restoration of HPA regulation of ovulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Several clear gaps have been identified in the existing literature. Short-term studies of over-training have not always produced the disturbance to ovulation identified in the observational studies, bringing up the question of the roles of longer term training and chronic energy deficit. We believe this merits further investigation in specific cohorts, such as professional athletes. Another gap is the complete absence of exercise-based interventions in anovulatory women with a normal body mass index (BMI). The possibly unjustified focus on weight loss rather than the exercise programme means there is also a lack of studies comparing types of physical activity, intensity and settings. We believe that these gaps are delaying an efficient and effective use of exercise as a therapeutic modality to treat anovulatory infertility.},

Recommendations are made for overweight/obese women to lose weight via diet and exercise. Women with PCOS should also consider maintaining a diet that is patterned after the type 2 diabetes diet. This diet includes an increase in fiber and a decrease in refined carbohydrates, as well as a decrease in trans and saturated fats and an increase in omega-3 and omega-9 fatty acids. Foods that contain anti-inflammatory compounds (fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, and red wine) should also be emphasized.

	abstract = {The influence of dietary fiber on energy regulation remains controversial. This review summarizes published studies on the effects of dietary fiber on hunger, satiety, energy intake, and body composition in healthy individuals. Under conditions of fixed energy intake, the majority of studies indicate that an increase in either soluble or insoluble fiber intake increases postmeal satiety and decreases subsequent hunger. When energy intake is ad libitum, mean values for published studies indicate that consumption of an additional 14 g/day fiber for {\textgreater}2 days is associated with a 10\% decrease in energy intake and body weight loss of 1.9 kg over 3.8 months. Furthermore, obese individuals may exhibit a greater suppression of energy intake and body weight loss (mean energy intake in all studies was reduced to 82\% by higher fiber intake in overweight/obese people versus 94\% in lean people; body weight loss was 2.4 kg versus 0.8 kg). These amounts are very similar to the mean changes in energy intake and body weight changes observed when dietary fat content is lowered from 38\% to 24\% of energy intake in controlled studies of nonobese and obese subjects. The observed changes in energy intake and body weight occur both when the fiber is from naturally high-fiber foods and when it is from a fiber supplement. In view of the fact that mean dietary fiber intake in the United States is currently only 15 g/day (i.e., approximately half the American Heart Association recommendation of 25-30 g/day), efforts to increase dietary fiber in individuals consuming {\textless}25 g/day may help to decrease the currently high national prevalence of obesity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Typically, management of PCOS focuses on lifestyle changes (exercise and diet), aiming to alleviate symptoms, and lower the associated risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to analyse evidence on the effectiveness of exercise in the management of PCOS, when compared to (i) usual care, (ii) diet alone, and (iii) exercise combined with diet, and also exercise combined with diet, compared to (i) control or usual care and (ii) diet alone.
METHODS: Relevant databases were searched (June 2017) with no time limit for trial inclusion. Eligible trials employed a randomised or quasi-randomised design to measure the chronic effects of exercise, or exercise and diet in women with PCOS.
RESULTS: Searches returned 2390 articles; of those, 27 papers from 18 trials were included. Results are presented as mean difference (MD) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). Compared with control, exercise had a statistical effect on change from baseline fasting insulin (MD - 2.44 μIU/mL, 95\% CIs - 4.24 to - 0.64; very low-quality evidence), HOMA-IR (- 0.57, - 0.99 to - 0.14; very low-quality evidence), total cholesterol (- 5.88 mg/dL, - 9.92 to - 1.83; low-quality evidence), LDL cholesterol (- 7.39 mg/dL, - 9.83 to - 4.95; low-quality evidence), and triglycerides (- 4.78 mg/dL, - 7.52 to - 2.05; low-quality evidence). Exercise also improved VO2 max (3.84 ml/kg/min, 2.87 to 4.81), waist circumference (- 2.62 cm, - 4.13 to - 1.11), and body fat percentage (- 1.39\%, - 2.61 to - 0.18) when compared with usual care. No effect was found for change value systolic/diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, HDL cholesterol (all low-quality evidence), or waist-to-hip ratio. Many favourable change score findings were supported by post-intervention value analyses: fasting insulin (- 2.11 μIU/mL, - 3.49 to - 0.73), total cholesterol (- 6.66 mg/dL, - 11.14 to - 2.17), LDL cholesterol (- 6.91 mg/dL, - 12.02 to - 1.80), and VO2 max (5.01 ml/kg/min, 3.48 to 6.54). Statistically lower BMI (- 1.02 kg/m2, - 1.81 to - 0.23) and resting heart rate (- 3.26 beats/min - 4.93 to - 1.59) were also revealed in post-intervention analysis. Subgroup analyses revealed the greatest improvements in overweight/obese participants, and more outcomes improved when interventions were supervised, aerobic in nature, or of a shorter duration. Based on limited data, we found no differences for any outcome between the effects of exercise and diet combined, and diet alone. It was not possible to compare exercise vs diet or exercise and diet combined vs diet.
CONCLUSION: Statistically beneficial effects of exercise were found for a range of metabolic, anthropometric, and cardiorespiratory fitness-related outcomes. However, caution should be adopted when interpreting these findings since many outcomes present modest effects and wide CIs, and statistical effects in many analyses are sensitive to the addition/removal of individual trials. Future work should focus on rigorously designed, well-reported trials that make comparisons involving both exercise and diet.

	abstract = {Tumors contain oxygenated and hypoxic regions, so the tumor cell population is heterogeneous. Hypoxic tumor cells primarily use glucose for glycolytic energy production and release lactic acid, creating a lactate gradient that mirrors the oxygen gradient in the tumor. By contrast, oxygenated tumor cells have been thought to primarily use glucose for oxidative energy production. Although lactate is generally considered a waste product, we now show that it is a prominent substrate that fuels the oxidative metabolism of oxygenated tumor cells. There is therefore a symbiosis in which glycolytic and oxidative tumor cells mutually regulate their access to energy metabolites. We identified monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) as the prominent path for lactate uptake by a human cervix squamous carcinoma cell line that preferentially utilized lactate for oxidative metabolism. Inhibiting MCT1 with alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC) or siRNA in these cells induced a switch from lactate-fueled respiration to glycolysis. A similar switch from lactate-fueled respiration to glycolysis by oxygenated tumor cells in both a mouse model of lung carcinoma and xenotransplanted human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells was observed after administration of CHC. This retarded tumor growth, as the hypoxic/glycolytic tumor cells died from glucose starvation, and rendered the remaining cells sensitive to irradiation. As MCT1 was found to be expressed by an array of primary human tumors, we suggest that MCT1 inhibition has clinical antitumor potential.},

	abstract = {Intra-abdominal tumors, such as ovarian cancer, have a clear predilection for metastasis to the omentum, an organ primarily composed of adipocytes. Currently, it is unclear why tumor cells preferentially home to and proliferate in the omentum, yet omental metastases typically represent the largest tumor in the abdominal cavities of women with ovarian cancer. We show here that primary human omental adipocytes promote homing, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and that adipokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediate these activities. Adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell coculture led to the direct transfer of lipids from adipocytes to ovarian cancer cells and promoted in vitro and in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, coculture induced lipolysis in adipocytes and β-oxidation in cancer cells, suggesting adipocytes act as an energy source for the cancer cells. A protein array identified upregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4, also known as aP2) in omental metastases as compared to primary ovarian tumors, and FABP4 expression was detected in ovarian cancer cells at the adipocyte-tumor cell interface. FABP4 deficiency substantially impaired metastatic tumor growth in mice, indicating that FABP4 has a key role in ovarian cancer metastasis. These data indicate adipocytes provide fatty acids for rapid tumor growth, identifying lipid metabolism and transport as new targets for the treatment of cancers where adipocytes are a major component of the microenvironment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer cell adopts peculiar metabolic strategies aimed to sustain the continuous proliferation in an environment characterized by relevant fluctuations in oxygen and nutrient levels. Monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 can drive such adaptation permitting the transport across plasma membrane of different monocarboxylic acids involved in energy metabolism.
METHODS: Role of MCTs in tumor-stroma metabolic relationship was investigated in vitro and in vivo using transformed prostate epithelial cells, carcinoma cell lines and normal fibroblasts. Moreover prostate tissues from carcinoma and benign hypertrophy cases were analyzed for individuating clinical-pathological implications of MCT1 and MCT4 expression.
RESULTS: Transformed prostate epithelial (TPE) and prostate cancer (PCa) cells express both MCT1 and MCT4 and demonstrated variable dependence on aerobic glycolysis for maintaining their proliferative rate. In glucose-restriction the presence of L-lactate determined, after 24 h of treatment, in PCa cells the up-regulation of MCT1 and of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1), and reduced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase respect to untreated cells. The blockade of MCT1 function, performed by si RNA silencing, determined an appreciable antiproliferative effect when L-lactate was utilized as energetic fuel. Accordingly L-lactate released by high glycolytic human diploid fibroblasts WI-38 sustained survival and growth of TPE and PCa cells in low glucose culture medium. In parallel, the treatment with conditioned medium from PCa cells was sufficient to induce glycolytic metabolism in WI-38 cells, with upregulation of HIF-1a and MCT4. Co-injection of PCa cells with high glycolytic WI-38 fibroblasts determined an impressive increase in tumor growth rate in a xenograft model that was abrogated by MCT1 silencing in PCa cells. The possible interplay based on L-lactate shuttle between tumor and stroma was confirmed also in human PCa tissue where we observed a positive correlation between stromal MCT4 and tumor MCT1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that PCa progression may benefit of MCT1 expression in tumor cells and of MCT4 in tumor-associated stromal cells. Therefore, MCTs may result promising therapeutic targets in different phases of neoplastic transformation according to a strategy aimed to contrast the energy metabolic adaptation of PCa cells to stressful environments.},

Here we developed a method for identifying novel cancer targets via negative-selection RNAi screening using a human breast cancer xenograft model at an orthotopic site in the mouse. Using this method, we screened a set of metabolic genes associated with aggressive breast cancer and stemness to identify those required for in vivo tumorigenesis. Among the genes identified, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) is in a genomic region of recurrent copy number gain in breast cancer and PHGDH protein levels are elevated in 70\% of oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancers. PHGDH catalyses the first step in the serine biosynthesis pathway, and breast cancer cells with high PHGDH expression have increased serine synthesis flux. Suppression of PHGDH in cell lines with elevated PHGDH expression, but not in those without, causes a strong decrease in cell proliferation and a reduction in serine synthesis. We find that PHGDH suppression does not affect intracellular serine levels, but causes a drop in the levels of α-ketoglutarate, another output of the pathway and a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate. In cells with high PHGDH expression, the serine synthesis pathway contributes approximately 50\% of the total anaplerotic flux of glutamine into the TCA cycle. These results reveal that certain breast cancers are dependent upon increased serine pathway flux caused by PHGDH overexpression and demonstrate the utility of in vivo negative-selection RNAi screens for finding potential anticancer targets.},

Using a metabolomics approach with isotope labeling, we found that in some cancer cells a relatively large amount of glycolytic carbon is diverted into serine and glycine metabolism through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). An analysis of human cancers showed that PHGDH is recurrently amplified in a genomic region of focal copy number gain most commonly found in melanoma. Decreasing PHGDH expression impaired proliferation in amplified cell lines. Increased expression was also associated with breast cancer subtypes, and ectopic expression of PHGDH in mammary epithelial cells disrupted acinar morphogenesis and induced other phenotypic alterations that may predispose cells to transformation. Our findings show that the diversion of glycolytic flux into a specific alternate pathway can be selected during tumor development and may contribute to the pathogenesis of human cancer.},

	abstract = {Cancer cells acquire distinct metabolic adaptations to survive stress associated with tumour growth and to satisfy the anabolic demands of proliferation. The tumour suppressor protein p53 (also known as TP53) influences a range of cellular metabolic processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutaminolysis and anti-oxidant response. In contrast to its role in promoting apoptosis during DNA-damaging stress, p53 can promote cell survival during metabolic stress, a function that may contribute not only to tumour suppression but also to non-cancer-associated functions of p53. Here we show that human cancer cells rapidly use exogenous serine and that serine deprivation triggered activation of the serine synthesis pathway and rapidly suppressed aerobic glycolysis, resulting in an increased flux to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Transient p53-p21 (also known as CDKN1A) activation and cell-cycle arrest promoted cell survival by efficiently channelling depleted serine stores to glutathione synthesis, thus preserving cellular anti-oxidant capacity. Cells lacking p53 failed to complete the response to serine depletion, resulting in oxidative stress, reduced viability and severely impaired proliferation. The role of p53 in supporting cancer cell proliferation under serine starvation was translated to an in vivo model, indicating that serine depletion has a potential role in the treatment of p53-deficient tumours.},

The gene encoding the enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which catalyzes the first committed step of serine biosynthesis, is overexpressed in tumors and cancer cell lines via focal amplification and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated up-regulation. PHGDH-overexpressing cells are exquisitely sensitive to genetic ablation of the pathway. Here, we report the discovery of a selective small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH, CBR-5884, identified by screening a library of 800,000 drug-like compounds. CBR-5884 inhibited de novo serine synthesis in cancer cells and was selectively toxic to cancer cell lines with high serine biosynthetic activity. Biochemical characterization of the inhibitor revealed that it was a noncompetitive inhibitor that showed a time-dependent onset of inhibition and disrupted the oligomerization state of PHGDH. The identification of a small molecule inhibitor of PHGDH not only enables thorough preclinical evaluation of PHGDH as a target in cancers, but also provides a tool with which to study serine metabolism.},

Oncogenic Kras mutation is the signature event in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), serving a critical role in tumor initiation. Here, an inducible Kras(G12D)-driven PDAC mouse model establishes that advanced PDAC remains strictly dependent on Kras(G12D) expression. Transcriptome and metabolomic analyses indicate that Kras(G12D) serves a vital role in controlling tumor metabolism through stimulation of glucose uptake and channeling of glucose intermediates into the hexosamine biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathways (PPP). These studies also reveal that oncogenic Kras promotes ribose biogenesis. Unlike canonical models, we demonstrate that Kras(G12D) drives glycolysis intermediates into the nonoxidative PPP, thereby decoupling ribose biogenesis from NADP/NADPH-mediated redox control. Together, this work provides in vivo mechanistic insights into how oncogenic Kras promotes metabolic reprogramming in native tumors and illuminates potential metabolic targets that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit in PDAC.},

Induction of the ATF4 pathway during nutrient depletion requires AKT and NRF2 downstream of KRAS. The tumor suppressor KEAP1 strongly influences the outcome of activation of this pathway during nutrient stress; loss of KEAP1 in KRAS mutant cells leads to apoptosis. Through ATF4 regulation, KRAS alters amino acid uptake and asparagine biosynthesis. The ATF4 target asparagine synthetase (ASNS) contributes to apoptotic suppression, protein biosynthesis, and mTORC1 activation. Inhibition of AKT suppressed ASNS expression and, combined with depletion of extracellular asparagine, decreased tumor growth. Therefore, KRAS is important for the cellular response to nutrient stress, and ASNS represents a promising therapeutic target in KRAS mutant NSCLC.},

Recently, there have been several studies to elucidate metabolism reprogramming in cancer. However, it remains to be investigated how mutated KRAS can coordinate the metabolic shift to sustain CRC tumor growth. In this study, we found that KRAS mutation in CRC caused alteration in amino acid metabolism. KRAS mutation causes a marked decrease in aspartate level and an increase in asparagine level in CRC. Using several human CRC cell lines and clinical specimens of primary CRC, we demonstrated that the expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an enzyme that synthesizes asparagine from aspartate, was upregulated by mutated KRAS and that ASNS expression was induced by KRAS-activated signaling pathway, in particular PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Importantly, we demonstrated that KRAS-mutant CRC cells could become adaptive to glutamine depletion through asparagine biosynthesis by ASNS and that asparagine addition could rescue the inhibited growth and viability of cells grown under the glutamine-free condition in vitro. Notably, a pronounced growth suppression of KRAS-mutant CRC was observed upon ASNS knockdown in vivo. Furthermore, combination of L-asparaginase plus rapamycin markedly suppressed the growth of KRAS-mutant CRC xenografts in vivo, whereas either L-asparaginase or rapamycin alone was not effective. These results indicate ASNS might be a novel therapeutic target against CRCs with mutated KRAS.},

It has been argued that sedentary time is likely to be additional to the risks associated with insufficient moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. New evidence identifies relationships of too much sitting with overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers and other adverse health outcomes. There is a need for a broader base of evidence on the likely health benefits of changing the relevant sedentary behaviours, particularly gathering evidence on underlying mechanisms and dose–response relationships. However, as remains the case for physical activity, there is a research agenda to be pursued in order to identify the potentially modifiable environmental and social determinants of sedentary behaviour. Such evidence is required so as to understand what might need to be changed in order to influence sedentary behaviours and to work towards population-wide impacts on prolonged sitting time. In this context, the research agenda needs to focus particularly on what can inform broad, evidence-based environmental and policy initiatives. We consider what has been learned from research on relationships of environmental and social attributes and physical activity; provide an overview of recent-emerging evidence on relationships of environmental attributes with sedentary behaviour; argue for the importance of conducting international comparative studies and addressing life-stage issues and socioeconomic inequalities and we propose a conceptual model within which this research agenda may be addressed.},

	abstract = {There is now overwhelming evidence that regular physical activity has important and wide-ranging health benefits. These range from reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers to enhanced function and preservation of function with age. As a member of the geriatric set, I am personally delighted that there is strong emerging evidence that activity delays cognitive decline and is good for brain health as well as having extensive benefits for the rest of the body.I believe that evidence supports the conclusion that physical inactivity is one of the most important public health problems of the 21st century, and may even be the most important. This is not to deny the relevance of other health issues; and certainly we need to pay much more attention to healthful eating habits, smoking prevention and cessation programmes, and state-of-the art and evidence-based preventive medical care. My overriding concern is that the crucial importance of physical activity is undervalued and underappreciated by many individuals in public health and clinical medicine. Figure …},

	abstract = {Summary. To investigate further the hormonal and metabolic adaptations occurring when carbohydrates are ingested after prolonged exercise, we have compared the fate of a 100-g oral glucose load (using ‘naturally labelled’13C-glucose) in healthy volunteers after an overnight fast at rest either without previous exercise or after a 3-h exercise performed on a treadmill at about 50\% of the individual V̇o2 max. In comparison to the control conditions, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed in the post-exercise recovery period was characterized by a greater rise in peripheral blood glucose levels and delayed insulin response. Plasma glucagon values were significantly elevated at the time glucose was given (+48 ±13 pg ml-1) and at the end of the OGTT. Plasma-free fatty acid (FFA) levels were 1675 ± 103 μEq 1-1 when glucose was given, and subsequently reduced to values similar to those observed in the control conditions. Indirect calorimetry indicated that OGTT in post-exercise recovery was associated with decreased carbohydrate and increased lipid oxidation when compared to control conditions. Exogenous glucose oxidation was also significantly reduced: 25·1 ± 2·6 vs. 35·9 ± 1·9 g per 7 h. We suggest that the higher plasma glucagon levels and the delayed insulin response played a role in the decreased hepatic glucose retention previously described by others in post-exercise recovery. Our data also suggest that the higher lipid oxidation rate observed at the time glucose was given in the post-exercise period could explain, according to the Randle ‘glucose-fatty acid cycle’, the decreased carbohydrate oxidation and the preferential muscle glycogen repletion already well documented. The reason why the lipid oxidation rate remains increased 3–7 h after glucose ingestion in spite of the fact that FFA levels at that time are similar to those observed in control conditions is still unknown; further kinetic studies are needed to clarify this point.},

Furthermore, poor methodological techniques predominate and results have been conflicting. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of exercise on clinical depression and depression resulting from mental illness. The chosen studies examined the effect of a chronic exercise paradigm (independent variable) on depression (dependent variable). Each study’s variables were coded: design, subjects, exercise, and dependent measure characteristics that could moderate the effect of exercise on depression. Moderator variables were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results from 30 studies showed an overall mean effect of −.72. Therefore, individuals who exercised were −.72 of a standard deviation less depressed than individuals who did not exercise. Moderating variables and implications for the prescription of exercise as an effective treatment for depression are discussed.},

Conversely, physical inactivity appears to be associated with the development of psychological disorders. Specific studies support the use of exercise as a treatment for depression. Exercise compares favorably to antidepressant medications as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression and has also been shown to improve depressive symptoms when used as an adjunct to medications. While not as extensively studied, exercise has been shown to be an effective and cost-efficient treatment alternative for a variety of anxiety disorders.

	abstract = {Objective
To assess the efficacy of moderate aerobic physical activity with sleep hygiene education to improve sleep, mood and quality of life in older adults with chronic insomnia.

Methods
Seventeen sedentary adults aged ≥55 years with insomnia (mean age 61.6 (SD±4.3) years; 16 female) participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing 16 weeks of aerobic physical activity plus sleep hygiene to non-physical activity plus sleep hygiene. Eligibility included primary insomnia for at least 3 months, habitual sleep duration {\textless} 6.5 hours and a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score {\textgreater} 5. Outcomes included sleep quality, mood and quality of life questionnaires (PSQI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS], Short-form 36 [SF-36], Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]).

Results
The physical activity group improved in sleep quality on the global PSQI (p{\textless}0.0001), sleep latency (p=0.049), sleep duration (p=0.04), daytime dysfunction (p=0.027), and sleep efficiency (p=0.036) PSQI sub-scores compared to the control group. The physical activity group also had reductions in depressive symptoms (p=0.044), daytime sleepiness (p=0.02) and improvements in vitality (p=0.017) compared to baseline scores.

Conclusion
Aerobic physical activity with sleep hygiene education is an effective treatment approach to improve sleep quality, mood and quality of life in older adults with chronic insomnia.},

The search was performed using the following terms: yoga for schizophrenia, yoga for depression, yoga for anxiety, yoga for PTSD, yoga therapy, yoga for psychiatric disorders, complementary treatment, and efficacy of yoga therapy. Trials both unpublished and published with no limitation placed on year of publication were included; however, the oldest article included in the final meta-analysis was published in 2000., Study Selection: All available randomized, controlled trials of yoga for the treatment of mental illness were reviewed, and 10 studies were eligible for inclusion. As very few randomized, controlled studies have examined yoga for mental illness, this meta-analysis includes studies with participants who were diagnosed with mental illness, as well as studies with participants who were not diagnosed with mental illness but reported symptoms of mental illness. Trials were excluded due to the following: (1) insufficient information, (2) inadequate statistical analysis, (3) yoga was not the central component of the intervention, (4) subjects were not diagnosed with or did not report experiencing symptoms of one of the psychiatric disorders of interest (ie, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and PTSD), (5) study was not reported in English, and (6) study did not include a control group., Data Extraction: Data were extracted on participant diagnosis, inclusion criteria, treatment and control groups, duration of intervention, and results (pre-post mean and standard deviations, t values, and f values). Number, age, and sex ratio of participants were also obtained when available., Data Synthesis: The combined analysis of all 10 studies provided a pooled effect size of −3.25 (95\% CI, −5.36 to −1.14; P = .002), indicating that yoga-based interventions have a statistically significant effect as an adjunct treatment for major psychiatric disorders. Findings in support of alternative and complementary interventions may especially be an aid in the treatment of disorders for which current treatments are found to be inadequate or to carry severe liabilities., Conclusions: As current psychopharmacologic interventions for severe mental illness are associated with increased risk of weight gain as well as other metabolic side effects that increase patients’ risk for cardiovascular disease, yoga may be an effective, far less toxic adjunct treatment option for severe mental illness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proinflammatory cytokine levels may be associated with cancer stage, recurrence, and survival. The objective of this study was to determine whether cytokine levels were associated with dietary patterns and fat-soluble micronutrients in patients with previously untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 160 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC who completed pretreatment food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and health surveys. Dietary patterns were derived from FFQs using principal component analysis. Pretreatment serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and serum carotenoid and tocopherol levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression models examined associations between cytokines and quartiles of reported and serum dietary variables.
RESULTS: Three dietary patterns emerged: whole foods, Western, and convenience foods. In multivariable analyses, higher whole foods pattern scores were significantly associated with lower levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ (P ≤ .001, P = .008, and P = .03, respectively). Significant inverse associations were reported between IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ levels and quartiles of total reported carotenoid intake (P = .006, P = .04, and P = .04, respectively). There was an inverse association between IFN-γ levels and serum α-tocopherol levels (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Consuming a pretreatment diet rich in vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and whole grains may be associated with lower proinflammatory cytokine levels in patients with HNSCC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary factors are known to influence colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, however, their association with CRC survival is unclear. Therefore, we prospectively examined the association between diet quality scores, dietary patterns and colorectal cancer (CRC) survival.
METHODS: 1201 women diagnosed with stage I-III CRC between 1986 and 2008, were followed through 2010. Diet was assessed via a food frequency questionnaire administered at least 6 months after diagnosis. We computed the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension score (DASH) and derived two dietary patterns, Western (unhealthy) and prudent (healthy), by principal component analysis for each woman.
RESULTS: During follow-up, we documented 435 deaths, including 162 from CRC. After adjusting for potential confounders, only a higher AHEI-2010 score was significantly associated with lower overall mortality (HR comparing extreme quintiles = 0.71, 95\% CI 0.52-0.98, p trend = 0.01) as well as borderline significantly with lower risk of CRC mortality by the trend test (HR Q5 vs Q1 = 0.72, 95\% CI = 0.43-1.21, p trend = 0.07). When AHEI-2010 components were examined separately, inverse associations for overall mortality were primarily accounted for by moderate alcohol intake (HR comparing abstainers vs 5-15 g/d = 1.30, 95\%CI = 1.05-1.61) and lower intake of sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juices combined (HR for each additional serving = 1.11, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.23). No other diet quality score or dietary pattern was associated with overall or CRC-specific mortality.
CONCLUSION: Higher AHEI-2010 score may be associated with lower overall mortality, moderate alcohol consumption and lower consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and juices combined appeared to account for most of the observed associations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relationship between changes in diet quality over time and the risk of death.
METHODS: We used Cox proportional-hazards models to calculate adjusted hazard ratios for total and cause-specific mortality among 47,994 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 25,745 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1998 through 2010. Changes in diet quality over the preceding 12 years (1986-1998) were assessed with the use of the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 score, the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score.
RESULTS: The pooled hazard ratios for all-cause mortality among participants who had the greatest improvement in diet quality (13 to 33\% improvement), as compared with those who had a relatively stable diet quality (0 to 3\% improvement), in the 12-year period were the following: 0.91 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 0.97) according to changes in the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score, 0.84 (95 CI\%, 0.78 to 0.91) according to changes in the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, and 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.84 to 0.95) according to changes in the DASH score. A 20-percentile increase in diet scores (indicating an improved quality of diet) was significantly associated with a reduction in total mortality of 8 to 17\% with the use of the three diet indexes and a 7 to 15\% reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease with the use of the Alternate Healthy Eating Index and Alternate Mediterranean Diet. Among participants who maintained a high-quality diet over a 12-year period, the risk of death from any cause was significantly lower - by 14\% (95\% CI, 8 to 19) when assessed with the Alternate Healthy Eating Index score, 11\% (95\% CI, 5 to 18) when assessed with the Alternate Mediterranean Diet score, and 9\% (95\% CI, 2 to 15) when assessed with the DASH score - than the risk among participants with consistently low diet scores over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Improved diet quality over 12 years was consistently associated with a decreased risk of death. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).},

	abstract = {Recently, dietary pattern analysis has emerged as an alternative and complementary approach to examining the relationship between diet and the risk of chronic diseases. Instead of looking at individual nutrients or foods, pattern analysis examines the effects of overall diet. Conceptually, dietary patterns represent a broader picture of food and nutrient consumption, and may thus be more predictive of disease risk than individual foods or nutrients. Several studies have suggested that dietary patterns derived from factor or cluster analysis predict disease risk or mortality. In addition, there is growing interest in using dietary quality indices to evaluate whether adherence to a certain dietary pattern (e.g. Mediterranean pattern) or current dietary guidelines lowers the risk of disease. In this review, we describe the rationale for studying dietary patterns, and discuss quantitative methods for analysing dietary patterns and their reproducibility and validity, and the available evidence regarding the relationship between major dietary patterns and the risk of cardiovascular disease.},

Whole-grain consumption and risk of disease are presented as a model of food synergy. Food synergy is defined as additive or more than additive influences of foods and food constituents on health. Risk appears to be lower with consumption of whole grain than of refined grain; that is, benefit accrues when all edible parts of the grain are included (bran, germ, and endosperm). It appears that phytochemicals that are located in the fiber matrix, in addition to or instead of the fiber itself, are responsible for the reduced risk. Risk is further reduced if whole-grain foods are consumed in a diet otherwise high in plant foods. To gain full understanding of the pathways by which food synergies work, it is desirable to use several "top down" approaches, starting with the larger units, namely foods or food patterns, and working down to smaller units that provide protection from disease. Study of foods, food patterns, and individual nutrients or food components in reducing disease risk is seen as complementary. Epidemiologic, clinical trial, and in vitro approaches to such research are needed.},

We prospectively examined associations between pre- and post-treatment carbohydrate intake and recurrence, all-cause mortality, and HNSCC-specific mortality in a cohort of 414 newly diagnosed HNSCC patients. All participants completed pre- and post-treatment Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) and epidemiologic surveys. Recurrence and mortality events were collected annually. Multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards models tested associations between carbohydrate intake (categorized into low, medium and high intake) and time to recurrence and mortality, adjusting for relevant covariates. During the study period, there were 70 deaths and 72 recurrences. In pretreatment analyses, high intakes of total carbohydrate (HR: 2.29; 95\% CI: 1.23-4.25), total sugar (HR: 3.03; 95\% CI: 1.12-3.68), glycemic load (HR: 2.10; 95\% CI: 1.15-3.83) and simple carbohydrates (HR 2.26; 95\% CI 1.19-4.32) were associated with significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to low intake. High intakes of carbohydrate (HR 2.45; 95\% CI: 1.23-4.25) and total sugar (HR 3.03; 95\% CI 1.12-3.68) were associated with increased risk of HNSCC-specific mortality. In post-treatment analyses, medium fat intake was significantly associated with reduced risk of recurrence (HR 0.08; 95\% CI 0.01-0.69) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.27; 95\% CI 0.07-0.96). Stratification by tumor site and cancer stage in pretreatment analyses suggested effect modification by these factors. Our data suggest high pretreatment carbohydrate intake may be associated with adverse prognosis in HNSCC patients. Clinical intervention trials to further examine this hypothesis are warranted.},

This was a prospective cohort study of 463 participants baring a new head and neck cancer diagnosis who were recruited into the study prior to the initiation of any cancer therapy. Baseline (pre-treatment) dietary and clinical data were measured upon entry into the study cohort. Clinical outcomes were ascertained at annual medical reviews. Cox proportional hazard models were fit to examine the relationships between dietary fiber and whole grain intakes with recurrence and survival. There were 112 recurrence events, 121 deaths, and 77 cancer-related deaths during the study period. Pretreatment dietary fiber intake was inversely associated with risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 0.37, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.95, ptrend = 0.04). No statistically significant associations between whole grains and prognostic outcomes were found.

Short sleep duration along with other dimensions of poor sleep has been associated with obesity both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. These data suggest a potential causal relationship between poor sleep and greater rates of weight gain that may be related to effects of sleep on dietary intake or physical activity. However, there is also potential for reverse causation as obesity leads to many co-morbidities including sleep apnea that can disrupt sleep.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of publications using MEDLINE (1955-April 2009), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library and manual searches without language restrictions. We included studies if they were prospective with follow-up {\textgreater}3 years and had an assessment of sleep disturbances at baseline and incidence of type 2 diabetes. We recorded several characteristics for each study. We extracted quantity and quality of sleep, how they were assessed, and incident cases defined with different validated methods. We extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95\% CI and pooled them using random-effects models. We performed sensitivity analysis and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias.
RESULTS: We included 10 studies (13 independent cohort samples; 107,756 male and female participants, follow-up range 4.2-32 years, and 3,586 incident cases of type 2 diabetes). In pooled analyses, quantity and quality of sleep predicted the risk of development of type 2 diabetes. For short duration of sleep ({\textless} or =5-6 h/night), the RR was 1.28 (95\% CI 1.03-1.60, P = 0.024, heterogeneity P = 0.015); for long duration of sleep ({\textgreater}8-9 h/night), the RR was 1.48 (1.13-1.96, P = 0.005); for difficulty in initiating sleep, the RR was 1.57 (1.25-1.97, P {\textless} 0.0001); and for difficulty in maintaining sleep, the RR was 1.84 (1.39-2.43, P {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantity and quality of sleep consistently and significantly predict the risk of the development of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms underlying this relation may differ between short and long sleepers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have reported an association between self-reported short sleep duration and high blood pressure (BP). Our objective was to examine both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between objectively measured sleep and BP.
METHODS: This study is ancillary to the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort study. Blood pressure was measured in 2000 and 2001 and in 2005 and 2006. Sleep was measured twice using wrist actigraphy for 3 consecutive days between 2003 and 2005. Sleep duration and sleep maintenance (a component of sleep quality) were calculated. Analyses included 578 African Americans and whites aged 33 to 45 years at baseline. Outcome measures were systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) levels, 5-year change in BP, and incident hypertension.
RESULTS: After we excluded the patients who were taking antihypertensive medications and adjusted for age, race, and sex, shorter sleep duration and lower sleep maintenance predicted significantly higher SBP and DBP levels cross-sectionally as well as more adverse changes in SBP and DBP levels over 5 years (all P {\textless} .05). Short sleep duration also predicted significantly increased odds of incident hypertension (odds ratio, 1.37; 95\% confidence interval, 1.05-1.78). Adjustment for 16 additional covariates, including snoring and daytime sleepiness, slightly attenuated the associations between sleep and BP. Sleep duration appeared to mediate the difference between African Americans and whites in DBP change over time (P = .02).
CONCLUSION: Reduced sleep duration and consolidation predicted higher BP levels and adverse changes in BP, suggesting the need for studies to investigate whether interventions to optimize sleep may reduce BP.},

Heart rate decreased at a linear rate on both the HBT and recovery nights, but was 15 beats/min faster on the former.

The adenosine-receptor-antagonist, caffeine (100 mg), administered immediately prior to a nocturnal sleep episode, has previously been shown to lower sleep propensity as indexed by a reduced sleep efficiency, a reduced EEG power density in low delta frequencies and enhanced power density in the frequency range of sleep spindles. To further investigate the role of adenosine in sleep regulation we administered 200 mg of caffeine at 07.10 h and analyzed the sleep stages and EEG power spectra during the subsequent night in nine healthy men. Caffeine levels in saliva decreased from a maximum of 17 mumol/l one hour after intake, to 3 mumol/l immediately prior to the sleep episode starting at 23.00 h. Compared to placebo, sleep efficiency and total sleep time were significantly reduced. EEG power density in nonREM sleep was suppressed in the 0.25-0.5 Hz band and enhanced in the frequency range of sleep spindles (11.25-12.0 Hz and 13.25-14.0 Hz). In REM sleep EEG power density was suppressed in the frequency range of 0.75-4.5 and 5.25-6.0 Hz. The data indicate that a saliva level of caffeine as low as 3 mumol/l directly affects sleep propensity or, alternatively, that the presence of caffeine in the central nervous system during the waking episode reduces the progressive increase of sleep propensity associated with wakefulness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Night eating syndrome (NES) is characterized by evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal ingestion.
OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to assess the percentage of students complying with symptoms and behaviors consistent with the diagnostic criteria for NES, and explore its association with body mass index (BMI), dietary habits, physical activity, smoking status, and sleep patterns, among a sample of college students.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a sample of 413 undergraduate students, mean age of 20.6 ± 1.68 SD, at Central Michigan University. Students completed an online survey including demographic information and the Night Eating Diagnostic Questionnaire (NEDQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI). Participants were grouped based on self-reporting of the presence and frequency of night eating-related symptoms and behaviors related to the diagnostic criteria for NES as follows: normal, mild night eater, moderate night eater, and full-syndrome night eater. Pearson's Chi-squared, Student's t test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to test the association between students with and without any night eating behavior in relation to BMI, lifestyle variables, and sleep duration/quality.
RESULTS: Results showed that the proportion of students complying with symptoms and behaviors consistent with full-syndrome of NES was 1.2\%. There were no significant differences between students complying with symptoms and behaviors consistent with any level of NES and those without any night eating behavior regarding BMI, eating habits, physical activity, and smoking status. NES was significantly related to sleep duration (P = 0.023). Students complying with symptoms consistent with any level of NES reported shorter sleep time and had higher total PSQI score (6.73 ± 4.06) than students without the syndrome (5.61 ± 2.61) (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Although the percentage of students complying with full-syndrome NES was relatively low in our student sample, those students had shorter sleep time and poorer sleep quality than the other groups. However, it is unclear whether evening hyperphagia is a response to a lack of sleep or vice versa, and further research is needed.

	abstract = {1. Both the timing of behavioural events (activity, sleep and social interactions) and the environmental light-dark cycle have been reported to contribute to entrainment of human circadian rhythms to the 24 h day. Yet, the relative contribution of those putative behavioural synchronizers to that of light exposure remains unclear. 2. To investigate this, we inverted the schedule of rest, sedentary activity and social contact of thirty-two young men either with or without exposure to bright light. 3. On this inverted schedule, the endogenous component of the core temperature rhythm of subjects who were exposed to bright light showed a significant phase shift, demonstrating that they were adapting to the new schedule. In contrast, the core temperature rhythm of subjects who were not exposed to bright light moved on average 0.2 h later per day and after 10 days had not significantly adapted to the new schedule. 4. The direction of phase shift in the groups exposed to bright light was dependent on the time of bright light exposure, while control subjects drifted to a later hour regardless of the timing of their schedule of sleep timing, social contact and meals. 5. These results support the concept that the light-dark cycle is the most important synchronizer of the human circadian system. They suggest that inversion of the sleep-wake, rest-activity and social contact cycles provides relatively minimal drive for resetting the human circadian pacemaker. 6. These data indicate that interventions designed to phase shift human circadian rhythms for adjustment to time zone changes or altered work schedules should focus on properly timed light exposure.},

	abstract = {Functional bowel disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are common disorders that have a significant impact on patients' quality of life. These disorders present major challenges to healthcare providers, as few effective medical therapies are currently available. Recently, there has been increasing interest in dietary therapies for IBS, particularly a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). Since ingestion of FODMAPs increases the delivery of readily fermentable substrates and water to the distal small intestine and colon-which results in luminal distention and gas-the reduction of FODMAPs in a patient's diet may improve functional gastrointestinal symptoms. This paper will review the pathophysiology of IBS and the role of FODMAPs for the treatment of this condition.},

	abstract = {The gastrointestinal microbiome is a diverse consortium of bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, and viruses that inhabit the gut of all mammals. Studies in humans and other mammals have implicated the microbiome in a range of physiologic processes that are vital to host health including energy homeostasis, metabolism, gut epithelial health, immunologic activity, and neurobehavioral development. The microbial genome confers metabolic capabilities exceeding those of the host organism alone, making the gut microbiome an active participant in host physiology. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and computational biology have revolutionized the field of microbiomics, permitting mechanistic evaluation of the relationships between an animal and its microbial symbionts. Changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome are associated with diseases in humans and animals including inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, immune-mediated conditions, and neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism spectrum disorder. While there remains a paucity of data regarding the intestinal microbiome in small animals, recent studies have helped to characterize its role in host animal health and associated disease states. This review is intended to familiarize small animal veterinarians with recent advances in the field of microbiomics and to prime them for a future in which diagnostic tests and therapies will incorporate these developments into clinical practice.},

The diet provides substrates for microbial fermentation, and, as the composition of the intestinal microbiota is disturbed in IBS patients, the link between diet, microbiota composition, and microbial fermentation products might have an essential role in IBS etiology. In this review, we summarize current evidence regarding the impact of diet and the intestinal microbiota on IBS symptoms, as well as the reported interactions between diet and the microbiota composition. On the basis of the existing data, we suggest pathways (mechanisms) by which diet components, via the microbial fermentation, could trigger IBS symptoms.

These people do not have significantly different abdominal symptoms to those who do not consult, but they do have greater levels of anxiety and lower quality of life. Internationally, there is a female predominance in the prevalence of IBS. There is 25\% less IBS diagnosed in those over 50 years and there is no association with socioeconomic status. IBS aggregates within families and the genetic and sociological factors potentially underlying this are reviewed.

Accordingly, manipulation of the gut microbiota in order to improve IBS symptoms has the last decade evolved as a novel treatment strategy. Several different approaches have been investigated in order to improve the gut microbiota composition. Dietary modifications including supplementation with fibers, prebiotics and probiotics are shown to improve symptoms and composition of gut microbiota in IBS, however the exact probiotic mixture beneficial for each individual remains to be identified. The use of antibiotics still needs confirmation, although promising results have been reported with use of rifaximin. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has recently gained a lot of attention, and several placebo-controlled trials investigating FMT pose promising results regarding symptom reduction and gut microbiota manipulation in IBS. However, more data regarding long-term effects is needed before FMT can be integrated as a customised treatment for IBS in the clinical routine.},

Small intestinal microbial composition, on the other hand, is significantly altered in symptomatic patients and does not correspond with aspirate culture results. In a pilot interventional study we found that switching from a high fiber diet to a low fiber, high simple sugar diet triggered FGID-related symptoms and decreased small intestinal microbial diversity while increasing small intestinal permeability.

One of the reasons for this paradigm shift is the realization that gut dysbiosis, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), causes IBS symptoms. Between 4\% and 78\% of patients with IBS and 1\% and 40\% of controls have SIBO; such wide variations in prevalence might result from population differences, IBS diagnostic criteria, and, most importantly, methods to diagnose SIBO. Although quantitative jejunal aspirate culture is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of SIBO, noninvasive hydrogen breath tests have been popular. Although the glucose hydrogen breath test is highly specific, its sensitivity is low; in contrast, the early-peak criteria in the lactulose hydrogen breath test are highly nonspecific. Female gender, older age, diarrhea-predominant IBS, bloating and flatulence, proton pump inhibitor and narcotic intake, and low hemoglobin are associated with SIBO among IBS patients. Several therapeutic trials targeting gut microbes using antibiotics and probiotics have further demonstrated that not all symptoms in patients with IBS originate in the brain but rather in the gut, providing support for the micro-organic basis of IBS. A recent proof-of-concept study showing the high frequency of symptom improvement in patients with IBS with SIBO further supports this hypothesis.},

The maintenance of a beneficial microbiota requires a homeostatic equilibrium within microbial communities, and between the microorganisms and the host. The gut microbiota composition may be affected by external factors, among them diet habits may be considered most important. In some pathological conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), celiac disease (CD), or neurological disorders (ND), specific dietary regimens as low-fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), ketogenic (KD), and gluten-free (GFD) diets are considered therapeutic. These kinds of diets are characterized by a reduction or exclusion of a specific nutrient from the entire dietary pattern. Despite these alimentary regimens showing beneficial effects on disease symptoms, they can affect microbiota composition, especially if they are protracted for a long time. To date, only a few studies have reported the effects of these diets on gut microbiota.

	abstract = {FODMAP, "Fermentable Oligo-, Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols", is a heterogeneous group of highly fermentable but poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates and polyols. Dietary FODMAPs might exacerbate intestinal symptoms by increasing small intestinal water volume, colonic gas production, and intestinal motility. In recent years the low-FODMAP diet for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has gained increasing popularity. In the present review we aim to summarize the physiological, clinical, and nutritional issues, suggesting caution in the prolonged use of this dietary treatment on the basis of the existing literature. The criteria for inclusion in the FODMAPs list are not fully defined. Although the low-FODMAP diet can have a positive impact on the symptoms of IBS, particularly bloating and diarrhea, the quality of the evidence is lower than optimal, due to frequent methodological flaws, particularly lack of a proper control group and/or lack of blinding. In particular, it remains to be proven whether this regimen is superior to conventional IBS diets. The drastic reduction of FODMAP intake has physiological consequences, e.g., on the intestinal microbiome and colonocyte metabolism, which are still poorly understood. A low-FODMAP diet imposes an important restriction of dietary choices due to the elimination of some staple foods, such as wheat derivatives, lactose-containing dairy products, many vegetables and pulses, and several types of fruits. For this reason, patients may be at risk of reduced intake of fiber, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, B and D vitamins, and natural antioxidants. The nutritional risk of the low-FODMAP diet may be higher in persons with limited access to the expensive, alternative dietary items included in the low-FODMAP diet.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, distension, constipation, diarrhea and flatulence have been noted in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The diversity of symptoms has meant that finding an effective treatment has been challenging with most treatments alleviating only the primary symptom. A novel treatment option for IBS and IBD currently generating much excitement is the low fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyol (FODMAP) diet. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the evidence of the efficacy of such a diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched through to March 2015 to identify relevant studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 \% confidence intervals were calculated for the effect of a low FODMAP diet on the reduction in IBS [Symptoms Severity Score (SSS)] score and increase in IBS quality of life (QOL) score for both randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomized interventions using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Six RCTs and 16 non-randomized interventions were included in the analysis. There was a significant decrease in IBS SSS scores for those individuals on a low FODMAP diet in both the RCTs (OR 0.44, 95 \% CI 0.25-0.76; I (2) = 35.52, p = 0.00) and non-randomized interventions (OR 0.03, 95 \% CI 0.01-0.2; I (2) = 69.1, p = 0.02). In addition, there was a significant improvement in the IBS-QOL score for RCTs (OR 1.84, 95 \% CI 1.12-3.03; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.39) and for non-randomized interventions (OR 3.18, 95 \% CI 1.60-6.31; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.89). Further, following a low FODMAP diet was found to significantly reduce symptom severity for abdominal pain (OR 1.81, 95 \% CI 1.13-2.88; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.56), bloating (OR 1.75, 95 \% CI 1.07-2.87; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.45) and overall symptoms (OR 1.81, 95 \% CI 1.11-2.95; I (2) = 0.00, p = 0.4) in the RCTs. In the non-randomized interventions similar findings were observed.
CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis supports the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Further research should ensure studies include dietary adherence, and more studies looking at greater number of patients and long-term adherence to a low FODMAP diet need to be conducted.},

RESULTS Nineteen of 22 FAP pedigrees were found to have mutations of APC, and 17 types APC mutations were identified. All the mutations were heterozygosity with autosomal dominant inheritance. APC mutations included 8 caused by frameshift, 3 by aberrant splicing, 2 by missense mutation, 2 by nonsense mutation, and 2 by large-fragment deletion. Frameshift mutation was the most common type of APC mutation, and Coding DNA Sequence 15 was the most common mutation site. Five novel APC mutations, including 1 with large-fragment deletion, were identified. CONCLUSIONS We systematically screened 17 mutations of APC from 22 Chinese pedigrees with FAP. This study will broaden the spectrum of known APC germline mutations and help understand the types and distribution of APC mutations among Chinese patients with FAP.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) is an ongoing multi-centre prospective cohort study designed to investigate the relationship between nutrition and cancer, with the potential for studying other diseases as well. The study currently includes 519 978 participants (366 521 women and 153 457 men, mostly aged 35–70 years) in 23 centres located in 10 European countries, to be followed for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality for several decades. At enrolment, which took place between 1992 and 2000 at each of the different centres, information was collected through a non-dietary questionnaire on lifestyle variables and through a dietary questionnaire addressing usual diet. Anthropometric measurements were performed and blood samples taken, from which plasma, serum, red cells and buffy coat fractions were separated and aliquoted for long-term storage, mostly in liquid nitrogen. To calibrate dietary measurements, a standardised, computer-assisted 24-hour dietary recall was implemented at each centre on stratified random samples of the participants, for a total of 36 900 subjects. EPIC represents the largest single resource available today world-wide for prospective investigations on the aetiology of cancers (and other diseases) that can integrate questionnaire data on lifestyle and diet, biomarkers of diet and of endogenous metabolism (e.g. hormones and growth factors) and genetic polymorphisms. First results of case–control studies nested within the cohort are expected early in 2003. The present paper provides a description of the EPIC study, with the aim of simplifying reference to it in future papers reporting substantive or methodological studies carried out in the EPIC cohort.},

We used data from 73,542 premenopausal and 103,344 postmenopausal women from 9 European countries, taking part in the EPIC study. RRs from Cox regression models were calculated, using measured height, weight, BMI and waist and hip circumferences; categorized by cohort-wide quintiles; and expressed as continuous variables, adjusted for study center, age and other risk factors. During 4.7 years of follow-up, 1,879 incident invasive breast cancers were identified. In postmenopausal women, current HRT modified the body size-breast cancer association. Among nonusers, weight, BMI and hip circumference were positively associated with breast cancer risk (all ptrend {\textless} or = 0.002); obese women (BMI {\textgreater} 30) had a 31\% excess risk compared to women with BMI {\textless} 25. Among HRT users, body measures were inversely but nonsignificantly associated with breast cancer. Excess breast cancer risk with HRT was particularly evident among lean women. Pooled RRs per height increment of 5 cm were 1.05 (95\% CI 1.00-1.16) in premenopausal and 1.10 (95\% CI 1.05-1.16) in postmenopausal women. Among premenopausal women, hip circumference was the only other measure significantly related to breast cancer (ptrend = 0.03), after accounting for BMI. In postmenopausal women not taking exogenous hormones, general obesity is a significant predictor of breast cancer, while abdominal fat assessed as waist-hip ratio or waist circumference was not related to excess risk when adjusted for BMI. Among premenopausal women, weight and BMI showed nonsignificant inverse associations with breast cancer.},

The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) is a prospective cohort that includes {\textgreater}500,000 participants from 10 European countries and has made a substantial contribution to knowledge in this research area. The purpose of this article is to summarize the findings published thus far from the EPIC study on the associations between fruit, vegetable, or fiber consumption and the risk of cancer at 14 different sites. The risk of cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract was inversely associated with fruit intake but was not associated with vegetable intake. The risk of colorectal cancer was inversely associated with intakes of total fruit and vegetables and total fiber, and the risk of liver cancer was also inversely associated with the intake of total fiber. The risk of cancer of the lung was inversely associated with fruit intake but was not associated with vegetable intake; this association with fruit intake was restricted to smokers and might be influenced by residual confounding due to smoking. There was a borderline inverse association of fiber intake with breast cancer risk. For the other 9 cancer sites studied (stomach, biliary tract, pancreas, cervix, endometrium, prostate, kidney, bladder, and lymphoma) there were no reported significant associations of risk with intakes of total fruit, vegetables, or fiber.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier analyses within the EPIC study showed that dietary fibre intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk, but results from some large cohort studies do not support this finding. We explored whether the association remained after longer follow-up with a near threefold increase in colorectal cancer cases, and if the association varied by gender and tumour location.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After a mean follow-up of 11.0 years, 4,517 incident cases of colorectal cancer were documented. Total, cereal, fruit, and vegetable fibre intakes were estimated from dietary questionnaires at baseline. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age, sex, and centre, and adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, education, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive use, and intakes of alcohol, folate, red and processed meats, and calcium. After multivariable adjustments, total dietary fibre was inversely associated with colorectal cancer (HR per 10 g/day increase in fibre 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.79-0.96). Similar linear associations were observed for colon and rectal cancers. The association between total dietary fibre and risk of colorectal cancer risk did not differ by age, sex, or anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary variables. Fibre from cereals and fibre from fruit and vegetables were similarly associated with colon cancer; but for rectal cancer, the inverse association was only evident for fibre from cereals.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strengthen the evidence for the role of high dietary fibre intake in colorectal cancer prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is one of the mechanisms linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association between several diet-quality scores and plasma concentrations of markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
DESIGN: Diet-quality scores on the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Diet Quality Index Revised (DQI-R), Recommended Food Score (RFS), and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Index (aMED) were calculated by using a food-frequency questionnaire that was administered in 1990 to 690 women in the Nurses' Health Study (ages 43-69 y, no cardiovascular disease or diabetes). Blood collection was completed in the same year. We used regression analysis to assess the associations between these diet-quality scores and plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, E-selectin, soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1.
RESULTS: The various diet-quality scores were significantly correlated with each other; correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.80 (all P values {\textless} 0.0001). After adjustment for age, body mass index, alcohol intake, physical activity, smoking status, and energy intake, the HEI and DQI-R were not significantly associated with any of the biomarkers, whereas the AHEI and aMED scores were associated with significantly lower concentrations of most biomarkers. The RFS was significantly associated with a lower concentration of E-selectin only. C-reactive protein concentrations were 30\% (P {\textless} 0.05) and 24\% (P {\textless} 0.05) lower in the top than in the bottom quintile of the AHEI and of the aMED, respectively
CONCLUSION: Higher AHEI and aMED scores were associated with lower concentrations of biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction and therefore may be useful as guidelines for reducing the risk of diseases involving such biological pathways.},

	abstract = {The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) measures adherence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, but the association between the HEI-2005 and risk of chronic disease is not known. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), which is based on foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk, was associated inversely with chronic disease risk previously. We updated the AHEI, including additional dietary factors involved in the development of chronic disease, and assessed the associations between the AHEI-2010 and the HEI-2005 and risk of major chronic disease prospectively among 71,495 women from the Nurses' Health Study and 41,029 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were free of chronic disease at baseline. During ≥24 y of follow-up, we documented 26,759 and 15,558 incident chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or nontrauma death) among women and men, respectively. The RR (95\% CI) of chronic disease comparing the highest with the lowest quintile was 0.84 (0.81, 0.87) for the HEI-2005 and 0.81 (0.77, 0.85) for the AHEI-2010. The AHEI-2010 and HEI-2005 were most strongly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes, and for both outcomes the AHEI-2010 was more strongly associated with risk than the HEI-2005 (P-difference = 0.002 and {\textless}0.001, respectively). The 2 indices were similarly associated with risk of stroke and cancer. These findings suggest that closer adherence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines may lower risk of major chronic disease. However, the AHEI-2010, which included additional dietary information, was more strongly associated with chronic disease risk, particularly CHD and diabetes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on the long-term association between low-carbohydrate diets and mortality are sparse.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of low-carbohydrate diets with mortality during 26 years of follow-up in women and 20 years in men.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of women and men who were followed from 1980 (women) or 1986 (men) until 2006. Low-carbohydrate diets, either animal-based (emphasizing animal sources of fat and protein) or vegetable-based (emphasizing vegetable sources of fat and protein), were computed from several validated food-frequency questionnaires assessed during follow-up.
SETTING: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals' Follow-up Study.
PARTICIPANTS: 85 168 women (aged 34 to 59 years at baseline) and 44 548 men (aged 40 to 75 years at baseline) without heart disease, cancer, or diabetes.
MEASUREMENTS: Investigators documented 12 555 deaths (2458 cardiovascular-related and 5780 cancer-related) in women and 8678 deaths (2746 cardiovascular-related and 2960 cancer-related) in men.
RESULTS: The overall low-carbohydrate score was associated with a modest increase in overall mortality in a pooled analysis (hazard ratio [HR] comparing extreme deciles, 1.12 [95\% CI, 1.01 to 1.24]; P for trend = 0.136). The animal low-carbohydrate score was associated with higher all-cause mortality (pooled HR comparing extreme deciles, 1.23 [CI, 1.11 to 1.37]; P for trend = 0.051), cardiovascular mortality (corresponding HR, 1.14 [CI, 1.01 to 1.29]; P for trend = 0.029), and cancer mortality (corresponding HR, 1.28 [CI, 1.02 to 1.60]; P for trend = 0.089). In contrast, a higher vegetable low-carbohydrate score was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.80 [CI, 0.75 to 0.85]; P for trend {\textless}/= 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.77 [CI, 0.68 to 0.87]; P for trend {\textless} 0.001).
LIMITATIONS: Diet and lifestyle characteristics were assessed with some degree of error. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were probably not substantively affected by residual confounding or an unmeasured confounder. Participants were not a representative sample of the U.S. population.
CONCLUSION: A low-carbohydrate diet based on animal sources was associated with higher all-cause mortality in both men and women, whereas a vegetable-based low-carbohydrate diet was associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been shown to lower blood pressure, but little is known about its long-term effect on cardiovascular end points. Our objective was to assess the association between a DASH-style diet adherence score and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in women.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, diet was assessed 7 times during 24 years of follow-up (1980-2004) with validated food frequency questionnaires. A DASH score based on 8 food and nutrient components (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, low-fat dairy, red and processed meats, sweetened beverages, and sodium) was calculated. Lifestyle and medical information was collected biennially with a questionnaire. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to adjust for potential confounders. The study population comprised 88,517 female nurses aged 34 to 59 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes in 1980. The main outcome measures were the numbers of confirmed incident cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction, CHD death, and stroke.
RESULTS: We documented 2129 cases of incident nonfatal myocardial infarction, 976 CHD deaths, and 2317 [corrected] cases of stroke. After adjustment for age, smoking, and other cardiovascular risk factors, the relative risks of CHD across quintiles of the DASH score were 1.0, 0.99, 0.86, 0.87, and 0.76 (95\% confidence interval, 0.67-0.85) (P{\textless}.001 for trend). The magnitude of risk difference was similar for nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. The DASH score was also significantly associated with lower risk of stroke (multivariate relative risks across quintiles of the DASH score were 1.0, 0.92, 0.91, 0.89, and 0.82) (P=.002 for trend). Cross-sectional analysis in a subgroup of women with blood samples showed that the DASH score was significantly associated with lower plasma levels of C-reactive protein (P=.008 for trend) and interleukin 6 (P=.04 for trend).
CONCLUSION: Adherence to the DASH-style diet is associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke among middle-aged women during 24 years of follow-up.},

However, the health benefits of the eating pattern and key elements contributing to those benefits are still being researched.

In people at risk for diabetes, the majority of studies report a protective effect of the MEP against the development of type 2 diabetes. Although more research is needed to determine whether study results can be achieved outside the Mediterranean geographical region, and especially in the United States, the high-quality individual foods and combinations of foods included in the MEP can be recommended as a healthful eating approach.},

	abstract = {Recently, dietary pattern analysis has emerged as an alternative and complementary approach to examining the relationship between diet and the risk of chronic diseases. Instead of looking at individual nutrients or foods, pattern analysis examines the effects of overall diet. Conceptually, dietary patterns represent a broader picture of food and nutrient consumption, and may thus be more predictive of disease risk than individual foods or nutrients. Several studies have suggested that dietary patterns derived from factor or cluster analysis predict disease risk or mortality. In addition, there is growing interest in using dietary quality indices to evaluate whether adherence to a certain dietary pattern (e.g. Mediterranean pattern) or current dietary guidelines lowers the risk of disease. In this review, we describe the rationale for studying dietary patterns, and discuss quantitative methods for analysing dietary patterns and their reproducibility and validity, and the available evidence regarding the relationship between major dietary patterns and the risk of cardiovascular disease.},

This Mediterranean diet pyramid is based on food patterns typical of Crete, much of the rest of Greece, and southern Italy in the early 1960s, where adult life expectancy was among the highest in the world and rates of coronary heart disease, certain cancers, and other diet-related chronic diseases were among the lowest. Work in the field or kitchen resulted in a lifestyle that included regular physical activity and was associated with low rates of obesity. The diet is characterized by abundant plant foods (fruit, vegetables, breads, other forms of cereals, potatoes, beans, nuts, and seeds), fresh fruit as the typical daily dessert, olive oil as the principal source of fat, dairy products (principally cheese and yogurt), and fish and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts, zero to four eggs consumed weekly, red meat consumed in low amounts, and wine consumed in low to moderate amounts, normally with meals. This diet is low in saturated fat ({\textless} or = 7-8\% of energy), with total fat ranging from {\textless} 25\% to {\textgreater} 35\% of energy throughout the region. The pyramid describes a dietary pattern that is attractive for its famous palatability as well as for its health benefits.},

METHODS: Self-reported alcohol use and abuse 1 year after diagnosis was analyzed.
RESULTS: Although current drinkers (44.5\% of 283 patients) had better overall QOL and fewer depressive symptoms, current social drinkers had the best scores, whereas current problem drinkers had the worst. Female sex, fewer depressive symptoms, less pain, and better eating function predicted better QOL. Oral function was the only predictor of 12-month alcohol use.
CONCLUSION: Depression, pain, and eating function predicted overall QOL. Alcohol consumption was not associated with QOL, but was associated with better oral function, which in turn predicted better QOL. Alcohol consumption itself does not improve QOL in this population, and these patients should be counseled regarding detrimental effects of continued drinking after treatment.},

The increase in incidence in head and neck cancer in a number of countries appears linked at least in part to contemporaneous rises in alcohol consumption. The relative increase in risk in women may also relate to increasing alcohol consumption. Women may be particularly sensitive to alcohol-induced tumours in the oral/oropharyngeal sites. The risk is dose related, but with a non-linear increase for heavy drinkers ({\textgreater}100 g i.e. 12 units/day). The type of alcoholic beverage consumed seems less important. Potential mechanisms include local toxic cellular proliferation; carcinogenic action of metabolites e.g. acetaldehyde or impurities; induction of enzymes which activate procarcinogens; reduction of the protective retinoic acid; genetic polymorphism may play a part in certain geographic locations. Alcohol is also linked to stage at presentation, risk of second primary and the occurrence of comorbidity. Public awareness of the risks of alcohol remains disappointingly low. Those in identifiable high-risk groups should perhaps be targeted specifically for counselling.},

The first study carried out at the ENT Department of the University hospitals of Heidelberg and Giessen (FRG) comprised 200 male patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck and 800 control subjects matched for sex, age, and residential area (1:4 matching design). Of the tumour patients, 4.5\% had never smoked, in contrast to 29.5\% of the control group. The average tobacco and alcohol consumption of the patients was approximately twice as high as in the control subjects. The highest alcohol and tobacco consumption was observed in patients suffering from oropharyngeal cancer. Tobacco and alcohol increased the risk of head and neck cancer in a dose-dependent fashion and acted as independent risk factors. In heavy smokers (greater than 60 pack-years) a relative risk of 23.4 (alcohol adjusted) was calculated. Combined alcohol and tobacco consumption showed a synergistic effect. The risk ratio increased more in a multiplicative than in an additive manner. Oral and laryngeal cancer were associated with the highest tobacco-associated risk values. The highest ethanol-associated risk values were associated with oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer. The second study was carried out at the ENT Department of the University of Heidelberg on 164 males with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and 656 control subjects matched for sex, age and residential area (1:4 matching design). Of the cases, 4.2\% had never smoked, compared with 28.5\% of the control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	issn = {0732-183X},
	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2005.05.514},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Many cancer patients take antioxidant vitamin supplements with the hope of improving the outcome of conventional therapies and of reducing the adverse effects of these treatments. A randomized trial was conducted to determine whether supplementation with antioxidant vitamins could reduce the occurrence and severity of acute adverse effects of radiation therapy and improve quality of life without compromising treatment efficacy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 540 head and neck cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Patients were randomly assigned into two arms. The supplementation with alpha-tocopherol (400 IU/d) and beta-carotene (30 mg/d) or placebos was administered during radiation therapy and for 3 years thereafter. During the course of the trial, supplementation with beta-carotene was discontinued because of ethical concerns.
RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned in the supplement arm tended to have less severe acute adverse effects during radiation therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.52 to 1.02). The reduction was statistically significant when the supplementation combined alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene for adverse effects to the larynx (OR, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.21 to 0.71) and overall at any site (OR, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 0.74). Quality of life was not improved by the supplementation. The rate of local recurrence of the head and neck tumor tended to be higher in the supplement arm of the trial (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 2.02).
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with high doses of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene during radiation therapy could reduce the severity of treatment adverse effects. However, this trial suggests that use of high doses of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy might compromise radiation treatment efficacy.},

RESULTS: Thirty-six events/167 patient-weeks (21.6\%) and 54 events/161 patient-weeks (33.5\%) of symptomatic mucositis were observed in VE and placebo groups, respectively (p =.038). VE reduced the risk by 36\%. Subjective data at the end of the treatment revealed that VE decreased pain grades 2 to 3 during RT (3 of 28 patients vs 14 of 26 patients, p =.0001). No significant influence was detected in survival.

However, treatment intensification also increases early and late toxicities. Dysphagia is an underestimated symptom in HNC patients. Impairment of swallowing process could cause malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration, and pneumonia. A comprehensive literature review finalized in May 2012 included searches of electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and CAB abstracts) and scientific societies meetings materials (American Society of Clinical Oncology, Associazione Italiana Radioterapia Oncologica, Associazione Italiana di Oncologia Cervico-Cefalica, American Head and Neck Society, and European Society for Medical Oncology). Hand-searches of HNC journals and reference lists were carried out. Approximately one-third of dysphagia patients developed pneumonia requiring treatment. Aspiration pneumonia associated mortality ranged from 20\% to 65\%. Unidentified dysphagia caused significant morbidity, increased mortality, and decreased the quality of life. In this review we underline definition, causes, predictive factors of dysphagia and report on pretreatment and on-treatment evaluation, suggesting some key points to avoid underestimation. A multi-parameter assessment of swallowing problems may allow an earlier diagnosis. An appropriate evaluation might lead to a better treatment of both symptoms and cancer.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to provide preliminary Canadian research assessing nutrition students’ cultural competence and to identify areas for future education initiatives in dietetic education that could ultimately improve dietitians’ cultural competence. A mixed-methods study was conducted using a 24-item questionnaire that was administered to students enrolled in third- and fourth-year undergraduate nutrition classes (n = 133). In total, 115 questionnaires were analyzed for quantitative data, and 109 were analyzed for qualitative data. The students scored an overall medium–high level of cultural competence. Out of the 5 areas examined (skills, attitudes, awareness, desires, knowledge), students’ multicultural knowledge scores were the lowest. It was found that a lower number of barriers to learning about other cultures were significantly associated with a higher overall cultural competence score, and taking a course in cultural foods significantly increased the students’ knowledge and overall cultural competence (P ≤ 0.05). The qualitative data found that students felt the cultural competence curriculum had gaps and identified several ideas for improvement. In conclusion, this research data provides novel insights into the cultural competence of Canadian dietetic students and additionally supports future research and curriculum development to enhance cultural competence.},

Marginal structural models are a new class of causal models the parameters of which are estimated through inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting; these models allow for appropriate adjustment for confounding. We describe the marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model and use it to estimate the causal effect of zidovudine on the survival of human immunodeficiency virus-positive men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. In this study, CD4 lymphocyte count is both a time-dependent confounder of the causal effect of zidovudine on survival and is affected by past zidovudine treatment. The crude mortality rate ratio (95\% confidence interval) for zidovudine was 3.6 (3.0-4.3), which reflects the presence of confounding. After controlling for baseline CD4 count and other baseline covariates using standard methods, the mortality rate ratio decreased to 2.3 (1.9-2.8). Using a marginal structural Cox model to control further for time-dependent confounding due to CD4 count and other time-dependent covariates, the mortality rate ratio was 0.7 (95\% conservative confidence interval = 0.6-1.0). We compare marginal structural models with previously proposed causal methods.},

	abstract = {Cognitive function is an important component of aging and predicts quality of life, functional independence, and risk of institutionalization. Advances in our understanding of the role of cardiovascular risks have shown them to be closely associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Because many cardiovascular risks are modifiable, it may be possible to maintain brain health and to prevent dementia in later life. The purpose of this American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association presidential advisory is to provide an initial definition of optimal brain health in adults and guidance on how to maintain brain health. We identify metrics to define optimal brain health in adults based on inclusion of factors that could be measured, monitored, and modified. From these practical considerations, we identified 7 metrics to define optimal brain health in adults that originated from AHA's Life's Simple 7: 4 ideal health behaviors (nonsmoking, physical activity at goal levels, healthy diet consistent with current guideline levels, and body mass index {\textless}25 kg/m2) and 3 ideal health factors (untreated blood pressure {\textless}120/{\textless}80 mm Hg, untreated total cholesterol {\textless}200 mg/dL, and fasting blood glucose {\textless}100 mg/dL). In addition, in relation to maintenance of cognitive health, we recommend following previously published guidance from the AHA/American Stroke Association, Institute of Medicine, and Alzheimer's Association that incorporates control of cardiovascular risks and suggest social engagement and other related strategies. We define optimal brain health but recognize that the truly ideal circumstance may be uncommon because there is a continuum of brain health as demonstrated by AHA's Life's Simple 7. Therefore, there is opportunity to improve brain health through primordial prevention and other interventions. Furthermore, although cardiovascular risks align well with brain health, we acknowledge that other factors differing from those related to cardiovascular health may drive cognitive health. Defining optimal brain health in adults and its maintenance is consistent with the AHA's Strategic Impact Goal to improve cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20\% and to reduce deaths resulting from cardiovascular disease and stroke by 20\% by the year 2020. This work in defining optimal brain health in adults serves to provide the AHA/American Stroke Association with a foundation for a new strategic direction going forward in cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention.},

	doi = {10.1161/STR.0b013e3182299496},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This scientific statement provides an overview of the evidence on vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia of later life are common. Definitions of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), neuropathology, basic science and pathophysiological aspects, role of neuroimaging and vascular and other associated risk factors, and potential opportunities for prevention and treatment are reviewed. This statement serves as an overall guide for practitioners to gain a better understanding of VCI and dementia, prevention, and treatment.
METHODS: Writing group members were nominated by the writing group co-chairs on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee, the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, and the Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writing group used systematic literature reviews (primarily covering publications from 1990 to May 1, 2010), previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and, when appropriate, formulate recommendations using standard American Heart Association criteria. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. After peer review by the American Heart Association, as well as review by the Stroke Council leadership, Council on Epidemiology and Prevention Council, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, the statement was approved by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.
RESULTS: The construct of VCI has been introduced to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury-not solely stroke-ranging from mild cognitive impairment through fully developed dementia. Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow are likely to be important components of the pathophysiological processes underlying VCI. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is emerging as an important marker of risk for Alzheimer disease, microinfarction, microhemorrhage and macrohemorrhage of the brain, and VCI. The neuropathology of cognitive impairment in later life is often a mixture of Alzheimer disease and microvascular brain damage, which may overlap and synergize to heighten the risk of cognitive impairment. In this regard, magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging techniques play an important role in the definition and detection of VCI and provide evidence that subcortical forms of VCI with white matter hyperintensities and small deep infarcts are common. In many cases, risk markers for VCI are the same as traditional risk factors for stroke. These risks may include but are not limited to atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, these same vascular risk factors may be risk markers for Alzheimer disease. Carotid intimal-medial thickness and arterial stiffness are emerging as markers of arterial aging and may serve as risk markers for VCI. Currently, no specific treatments for VCI have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, detection and control of the traditional risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease may be effective in the prevention of VCI, even in older people.
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are important. Understanding of VCI has evolved substantially in recent years, based on preclinical, neuropathologic, neuroimaging, physiological, and epidemiological studies. Transdisciplinary, translational, and transactional approaches are recommended to further our understanding of this entity and to better characterize its neuropsychological profile. There is a need for prospective, quantitative, clinical-pathological-neuroimaging studies to improve knowledge of the pathological basis of neuroimaging change and the complex interplay between vascular and Alzheimer disease pathologies in the evolution of clinical VCI and Alzheimer disease. Long-term vascular risk marker interventional studies beginning as early as midlife may be required to prevent or postpone the onset of VCI and Alzheimer disease. Studies of intensive reduction of vascular risk factors in high-risk groups are another important avenue of research.},

Evidence from clinical trials and systematic reviews demonstrates the potential of long-chain Omega-3 supplementation for learning and behavior. However, findings are inconclusive and in need of robust replication studies since such work is lacking.
OBJECTIVES: Replication of the 2012 DOLAB 1 study findings that a dietary supplementation with the long-chain omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had beneficial effects on the reading, working memory, and behavior of healthy schoolchildren.
DESIGN: Parallel group, fixed-dose, randomized (minimization, 30\% random element), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT).
SETTING: Mainstream primary schools (n = 84) from five counties in the UK in 2012-2015.
PARTICIPANTS: Healthy children aged 7-9 underperforming in reading ({\textless}20th centile). 1230 invited, 376 met study criteria.
INTERVENTION: 600 mg/day DHA (from algal oil), placebo: taste/color matched corn/soybean oil; for 16 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age-standardized measures of reading, working memory, and behavior, parent-rated and as secondary outcome teacher-rated.
RESULTS: 376 children were randomized. Reading, working memory, and behavior change scores showed no consistent differences between intervention and placebo group. Some behavioral subscales showed minor group differences.
CONCLUSIONS: This RCT did not replicate results of the earlier DOLAB 1 study on the effectiveness of nutritional supplementation with DHA for learning and behavior. Possible reasons are discussed, particularly regarding the replication of complex interventions.

An expanse of research has investigated the effects of omega fatty acids in relation to brain health but effects across the lifespan have not been widely evaluated. The present systematic review collated evidence from 25 randomized controlled trials (n = 3633) published since 2013. Compared with control groups, omega-3 supplementation generally correlated with improvements in blood biomarkers. Subsequently, these appear to benefit those with lower baseline fatty acid levels, who are breastfeeding or who have neuropsychiatric conditions. Whilst multiple studies indicate that omega fatty acids can protect against neurodegeneration in older adults, more work is needed in the years preceding the diagnosis of such medical conditions. Bearing in mind the scale of ageing populations and rising healthcare costs linked to poor brain health, omega supplementation could be a useful strategy for helping to augment dietary intakes and support brain health across the lifespan. Ongoing research is now needed using harmonious methodologies, supplement dosages, ratios and intervention periods to help formulate congruent conclusions.},

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have potent anti-inflammatory effects, reduce platelet aggregation, and regress atherosclerotic plaques. Since the discovery that the Greenland Eskimo population, whose diet is high in marine n-3 PUFAs, have a lower incidence of coronary heart disease than Western populations, numerous epidemiological studies to explore the associations of dietary intakes of fish and n-3 PUFAs with cardiovascular diseases, and large-scale clinical trials to identify the benefits of treatment with n-3 PUFAs have been conducted. In most of these studies the incidence and mortality of stroke were also evaluated mainly as secondary endpoints. Thus, a systematic literature review regarding the association of dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with stroke in the epidemiological studies and the treatment effects of n-3 PUFAs in the clinical trials was conducted. Moreover, recent experimental studies were also reviewed to explore the molecular mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of n-3 PUFAs after stroke.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To perform a systematic review of the validity of algorithms for identifying cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) using administrative and claims data.
METHODS: PubMed and Iowa Drug Information Service searches of the English language literature were performed to identify studies published between 1990 and 2010 that evaluated the validity of algorithms for identifying CVAs (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, intracranial hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) and/or TIAs in administrative data. Two study investigators independently reviewed the abstracts and articles to determine relevant studies according to pre-specified criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 35 articles met the criteria for evaluation. Of these, 26 articles provided data to evaluate the validity of stroke, seven reported the validity of TIA, five reported the validity of intracranial bleeds (intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage), and 10 studies reported the validity of algorithms to identify the composite endpoints of stroke/TIA or cerebrovascular disease. Positive predictive values (PPVs) varied depending on the specific outcomes and algorithms evaluated. Specific algorithms to evaluate the presence of stroke and intracranial bleeds were found to have high PPVs (80\% or greater). Algorithms to evaluate TIAs in adult populations were generally found to have PPVs of 70\% or greater.
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithms and definitions to identify CVAs and TIAs using administrative and claims data differ greatly in the published literature. The choice of the algorithm employed should be determined by the stroke subtype of interest.},

	volume = {6},
	issn = {1545-1151},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The objective of this cross-sectional study was to examine the nutrition literacy status of adults in the Lower Mississippi Delta.
METHODS: Survey instruments included the Newest Vital Sign and an adapted version of the Health Information National Trends Survey. A proportional quota sampling plan was used to represent educational achievement of residents in the Delta region. Participants included 177 adults, primarily African Americans (81\%). Descriptive statistics, chi2 analysis, analysis of variance, and multivariate analysis of covariance tests were used to examine survey data.
RESULTS: Results indicated that 24\% of participants had a high likelihood of limited nutrition literacy, 28\% had a possibility of limited nutrition literacy, and 48\% had adequate nutrition literacy. Controlling for income and education level, the multivariate analysis of covariance models revealed that nutrition literacy was significantly associated with media use for general purposes (F = 2.79, P = .005), media use for nutrition information (F = 2.30, P = .04), and level of trust from nutrition sources (F = 2.29, P = .005). Overall, the Internet was the least trusted and least used source for nutrition information. Only 12\% of participants correctly identified the 2005 MyPyramid graphic, and the majority (78\%) rated their dietary knowledge as poor or fair.
CONCLUSION: Compared with other national surveys, rates of limited health literacy among Delta adults were high. Nutrition literacy status has implications for how people seek nutrition information and how much they trust it. Understanding the causes and consequences of limited nutrition literacy may be a step toward reducing the burden of nutrition-related chronic diseases among disadvantaged rural communities.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate health literacy skills in relation to Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption while accounting for demographic variables.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: A community-based proportional sample of adults residing in the rural Lower Mississippi Delta.
METHODS: Instruments included a validated 158-item regional food frequency questionnaire and the Newest Vital Sign (scores range 0 to 6) to assess health literacy.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and multivariate linear regression.
RESULTS: Of 376 participants, the majority were African American (67.6\%), without a college degree (71.5\%), and household income level {\textless}\$20,000/year (55.0\%). Most participants (73.9\%) scored in the two lowest health literacy categories. The multivariate linear regression model to predict total HEI scores was significant (R(2)=0.24; F=18.8; P{\textless}0.01), such that every 1-point increase in health literacy was associated with a 1.21-point increase in HEI scores, while controlling for all other variables. Other significant predictors of HEI scores included age, sex, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation. Health literacy also significantly predicted SSB consumption (R(2)=0.15; F=6.3; P{\textless}0.01) while accounting for demographic variables. Every 1 point in health literacy scores was associated with 34 fewer kilocalories per day from SSBs. Age was the only significant covariate in the SSB model.
CONCLUSIONS: Although health literacy has been linked to numerous poor health outcomes, to our knowledge this is the first investigation to establish a relationship between health literacy and HEI scores and SSB consumption. Our study suggests that understanding the causes and consequences of limited health literacy is an important factor in promoting compliance to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between adherence to distinct dietary patterns and nutrition literacy.
DESIGN: We identified distinct dietary patterns using principal covariates regression (PCovR) and principal components analysis (PCA) from the Diet History Questionnaire II. Nutrition literacy was assessed using the Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (NLit). Cross-sectional relationships between dietary pattern adherence and global and domain-specific NLit scores were tested by multiple linear regression. Mean differences in diet pattern adherence among three predefined nutrition literacy performance categories were tested by ANOVA.
SETTING: Metropolitan Kansas City, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n 386) with at least one of four diet-related diseases.
RESULTS: Three diet patterns of interest were derived: a PCovR prudent pattern and PCA-derived Western and Mediterranean patterns. After controlling for age, sex, BMI, race, household income, education level and diabetes status, PCovR prudent pattern adherence positively related to global NLit score (P \&lt; 0·001, β = 0·36), indicating more intake of prudent diet foods with improved nutrition literacy. Validating the PCovR findings, PCA Western pattern adherence inversely related to global NLit (P = 0·003, β = -0·13) while PCA Mediterranean pattern positively related to global NLit (P = 0·02, β = 0·12). Using predefined cut points, those with poor nutrition literacy consumed more foods associated with the Western diet (fried foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, red meat, processed foods) while those with good nutrition literacy consumed more foods associated with prudent and Mediterranean diets (vegetables, olive oil, nuts).
CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition literacy predicted adherence to healthy/unhealthy diet patterns. These findings warrant future research to determine if improving nutrition literacy effectively improves eating patterns.},

STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently selected studies that compared outcomes by differences in directly measured health literacy or numeracy levels.
DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted article information into evidence tables; a second reviewer checked information for accuracy. Two reviewers independently rated study quality by using predefined criteria, and the investigative team jointly graded the overall strength of evidence.
DATA SYNTHESIS: 96 relevant good- or fair-quality studies in 111 articles were identified: 98 articles on health literacy, 22 on numeracy, and 9 on both. Low health literacy was consistently associated with more hospitalizations; greater use of emergency care; lower receipt of mammography screening and influenza vaccine; poorer ability to demonstrate taking medications appropriately; poorer ability to interpret labels and health messages; and, among elderly persons, poorer overall health status and higher mortality rates. Poor health literacy partially explains racial disparities in some outcomes. Reviewers could not reach firm conclusions about the relationship between numeracy and health outcomes because of few studies or inconsistent results among studies.
LIMITATIONS: Searches were limited to articles published in English. No Medical Subject Heading terms exist for identifying relevant studies. No evidence concerning oral health literacy (speaking and listening skills) and outcomes was found.
CONCLUSION: Low health literacy is associated with poorer health outcomes and poorer use of health care services.

	abstract = {Public trust in nutrition science is the foundation on which nutrition and health progress is based, including sound public health. An ASN-commissioned, independent Advisory Committee comprehensively reviewed the literature and available public surveys about the public's trust in nutrition science and the factors that influence it and conducted stakeholder outreach regarding publicly available information. The Committee selected 7 overlapping domains projected to significantly influence public trust: 1) conflict of interest and objectivity; 2) public benefit; 3) standards of scientific rigor and reproducibility; 4) transparency; 5) equity; 6) information dissemination (education, communication, and marketing); and 7) accountability. The literature review comprehensively explored current practices and threats to public trust in nutrition science, including gaps that erode trust. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of peer-reviewed material specifically focused on nutrition science. Available material was examined, and its analysis informed the development of priority best practices. The Committee proposed best practices to support public trust, appropriate to ASN and other food and nutrition organizations motivated by the conviction that public trust remains key to the realization of the benefits of past, present, and future scientific advances. The adoption of the best practices by food and nutrition organizations, such as ASN, other stakeholder organizations, researchers, food and nutrition professionals, companies, government officials, and individuals working in the food and nutrition space would strengthen and help ensure earning and keeping the public's continued trust in nutrition science.},

	abstract = {Consumers are often confused about nutrition research findings and recommendations. As content experts, it is essential that nutrition scientists communicate effectively. A case-study of the history of dietary fat science and recommendations is presented, summarizing presentations from an Experimental Biology Symposium that addressed techniques for effective scientific communication and used the scientific discourse of public understanding of dietary fats and health as an example of challenges in scientific communication. Decades of dietary recommendations have focused on balancing calorie intake and energy expenditure and decreasing fat. Reducing saturated fat has been a cornerstone of dietary recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. However, evidence from observational studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrates that replacing saturated fat with carbohydrates, specifically refined, has no benefit on CVD risk, while substituting polyunsaturated fats for either saturated fat or carbohydrate reduces risk. A significant body of research supports the unique health benefits of dietary patterns and foods that contain plant and marine sources of unsaturated fats. Yet, after decades of focus on low-fat diets, many consumers, food manufacturers, and restauranteurs remain confused about the role of dietary fats on disease risk and sources of healthy fats. Shifting dietary recommendations to focus on food-based dietary patterns would facilitate translation to the public and potentially remedy widespread misperceptions about what constitutes a healthful dietary pattern.},

In this paper, we will examine the trends occurring globally in the realm of nutrition and cardiovascular disease prevention and also present new data that international nutrition knowledge amongst cardiovascular disease providers is limited. In turn, this lack of knowledge has resulted in less patient education and counseling, which is having profound effects on cardiovascular disease prevention efforts worldwide.},

These changes have led some authors to suggest that there are food deserts in some urban areas, where food is difficult to access, especially for disadvantaged consumers. This study tests the food desert hypothesis by comparing the distance from food retailers to food secure and food insecure households in one urban, Midwest neighborhood. This study utilizes GIS to compare household survey respondent locations against the location of various types of area food retailers. Results of this study indicate no apparent difference between food secure and insecure households in the reported importance of distance on the decision to shop at various retailers. However, there were differences in the spatial relationship between households and retailers. Food insecure households tended to be located slightly farther from large food retailers and slightly closer to convenience stores. Furthermore, food insecure households reported traveling slightly farther to their primary food retailer. The differences between the two groups was, however, relatively small.},

	abstract = {Higher intakes of vegetables and fruits are associated with a lower risk of certain human cancers. A biomarker of vegetable and fruit intake would be a valuable research tool. A cross-sectional study assessed the association between plasma carotenoid concentrations and intakes of vegetables and fruits. Plasma carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, and lycopene) were measured in 50 male and 49 female participants, aged 18-37 years, with a wide range of habitual vegetable and fruit intakes. Dietary intakes were assessed via a food frequency questionnaire. Intake of vegetables and fruits and high carotenoid foods were measured. The sum of the plasma carotenoids (excluding lycopene) was highly correlated with intake of total vegetables and fruits (r = 0.59). Of the individual plasma carotenoids, plasma alpha-carotene had the highest correlation with intakes of both total vegetables (r = 0.50) and total fruits (r = 0.58). Intakes of foods with high carotenoid contents were correlated with their corresponding plasma concentrations as follows: high beta-carotene foods (r = 0.41); high lutein foods (r = 0.46); and high lycopene foods (r = 0.11). Multiple regression analyses showed that intake of total vegetables and fruits was the most significant determinant of each plasma carotenoid except lycopene. The utility of combining the plasma carotenoids as biomarkers of vegetable and fruit intake was assessed by a stepwise regression of total vegetable and fruit intake on plasma carotenoids. Significant determinants of intake of total vegetables and fruits were alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and energy intake (R2 = 0.53).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Advanced nations, influenced by a Western lifestyle, are in the midst of a health crisis, resulting largely from poor lifestyle choices. Epidemiologic, ecologic, and interventional studies have repeatedly indicated that most chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes, are the result of lifestyles fueled by poor nutrition and physical inactivity.In this article, we describe the practice of lifestyle medicine and its powerful effect on these modern instigators of premature disability and death. We address the economic benefits of prevention-based lifestyle medicine and its effect on our health care system: A system on the verge of bankruptcy. We recommend vital changes to a disastrous course. Many deaths and many causes of pain, suffering, and disability could be circumvented if the medical community could effectively implement and share the power of healthy lifestyle choices. We believe that lifestyle medicine should become the primary approach to the management of chronic conditions and, more importantly, their prevention. For future generations, for our own health, and for the Hippocratic Oath we swore to uphold ("First do no harm"), the medical community must take action. It is our hope that the information presented will inspire our colleagues to pursue lifestyle medicine research and incorporate such practices into their daily care of patients.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Agricultural water requirements differ between foods. Population-level dietary preferences are therefore a major determinant of agricultural water use. The “water footprint” (WF) represents the volume of water consumed in the production of food items, separated by water source; blue WF represents ground and surface water use, and green WF represents rain water use. We systematically searched for published studies using the WF to assess the water use of diets. We used the available evidence to quantify the WF of diets in different countries, and grouped diets in patterns according to study definition. “Average” patterns equated to those currently consumed, whereas “healthy” patterns included those recommended in national dietary guidelines. We searched 7 online databases and identified 41 eligible studies that reported the dietary green WF, blue WF, or total WF (green plus blue) (1964 estimates for 176 countries). The available evidence suggests that, on average, European (170 estimates) and Oceanian (18 estimates) dietary patterns have the highest green WFs (median per capita: 2999 L/d and 2924 L/d, respectively), whereas Asian dietary patterns (98 estimates) have the highest blue WFs (median: 382 L/d per capita). Foods of animal origin are major contributors to the green WFs of diets, whereas cereals, fruits, nuts, and oils are major contributors to the blue WF of diets. “Healthy” dietary patterns (425 estimates) had green WFs that were 5.9\% (95\% CI: −7.7, −4.0) lower than those of “average” dietary patterns, but they did not differ in their blue WFs. Our review suggests that changes toward healthier diets could reduce total water use of agriculture, but would not affect blue water use. Rapid dietary change and increasing water security concerns underscore the need for a better understanding of the amount and type of water used in food production to make informed policy decisions.},

	abstract = {With increasing appreciation of the complexity of diets consumed by free-living individuals, there is interest in the assessment of the overall diet or dietary patterns in which multiple related dietary characteristics are considered as a single exposure. The 2 most frequently used methods to derive dietary patterns use (i) scores or indexes based on prevailing hypotheses about the role of dietary factors in disease prevention; and (ii) factors and clusters from exploration of available dietary data. A third method, a hybrid of the hypothesis-driven and data-driven methods, attempts to predict food combinations related to nutrients or biomarkers with hypothesized associations with particular health outcomes. Dietary patterns derived from the first 2 approaches have been examined in relation to nutritional and disease biomarkers and various health outcomes, and generally show the desirable dietary pattern to be consistent with prevalent beliefs about what constitutes a healthful diet. Results from observational studies suggest that the healthful dietary patterns were associated with significant but modest risk reduction (15\%–30\%) for all-cause mortality and coronary heart disease. Findings for various cancers have been inconsistent. The available randomized controlled intervention trials with a long-term follow-up to examine dietary patterns in relation to health outcome have generally produced null findings. Novel findings with the potential to change existing beliefs about diet and health relationships are yet to emerge from the dietary patterns research. The field requires innovation in methods to derive dietary patterns, validation of prevalent methods, and assessment of the effect of dietary measurement error on dietary patterns.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Few studies have considered if a posteriori dietary patterns (DPs) are generalizable across different centers or studies, or if they are consistently seen over time. To date, no systematic search of the literature on these topics has been carried out. A scoping review was conducted through a systematic search on the PubMed database. In the current review, we included the 34 articles examining the extent to which a posteriori DPs were consistently seen: 1) across centers from the same study or across different studies potentially representing different populations or countries (here indicated as cross-study reproducibility) and 2) over longer time periods (i.e., ≥2 y) (here indicated as stability over time). Selected articles (published in 1981–2019, 32\% from 2010 onwards) were based on observational studies, mostly from Europe and North America. Five articles were based on children and/or adolescents and 14 articles included adults (2 men; 12 women, of whom 3 were pregnant women). A posteriori DPs were mostly derived (32 articles) with principal component or factor analyses. Among the 9 articles assessing DP reproducibility across studies (number of centers/studies: 2–27; median: 3), 5 provided a formal assessment using statistical methods (4 index-based approaches of different complexity, 1 statistical model). A median of 4 DPs was reproduced across centers/studies (range: 1–7). Among the 25 articles assessing DP stability over time (number of time-occasions: 2–6; median: 3), 19 provided a formal assessment with statistical methods (17 index-based and/or test-based approaches, 1 statistical model, 1 with both strategies). The number and composition of DPs remained mostly stable over time. Based on the limited evidence collected, most identified DPs showed good reproducibility across studies and stability over time. However, when present within the single studies, the criteria for the formal assessment of cross-study reproducibility or stability over time were generally very basic.},

Recent studies describing the cancer protective effect of EPA and DHA have sparked a renewed interest in using these fatty acids for cancer prevention and treatment. Here, we summarize the significance of omega- 3 fatty acids in the initiation and progression of cancer, and review the complex mechanisms by which EPA and DHA are thought to have anticancer activities during cancer development. It is concluded that omega-3 fatty acids may exert their anticancer actions by influencing multiple targets implicated in various stages of cancer development, including cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, inflammation, metastasis and epigenetic abnormalities that are crucial to the onset and progression of cancer.},

While patients whose cancer cells express elevated CD73 are typically associated with an unfavorable outcome, the clinical impact of CD73 expression in patients with Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the prognostic significance of CD73 in HNSCC using gene and protein expression analyses. Our results demonstrate that high levels of CD73 are significantly associated with reduced overall survival in patients with HNSCC. We also investigated the functional role of CD73 in vitro and demonstrated that CD73 promotes HNSCC migration and invasion through adenosine A3R stimulation and the activation of EGF/EGFR signaling. Moreover, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated that CD73 promotes tumorigenesis. In conclusion, our study highlights a role for CD73 as a poor prognostic marker of patient survival and also as a candidate therapeutic target in HNSCCs.},

	abstract = {Human papillomavirus-16 (HPV-16) is a risk factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HPV-positive cancers have distinct disease cofactors and improved survival following treatment. There is conflicting evidence of a protective association of fruit consumption with HNSCC. As HPV-related disease is clinically distinct, we investigated whether the association between fruit consumption and HNSCC risk was modified by exposure to HPV-16. We studied 270 cases and 493 controls with fruit intake information and known HPV-16 antibody status. Cases were identified at nine Boston-area medical facilities between 1999 and 2003. Controls were randomly selected from the greater population and frequency matched to cases by age, gender, and town of residence. Controlling for age, gender, race, smoking, alcohol, total energy intake, body mass index, and education, the seronegative individuals had a significantly lower risk of HNSCC with increasing total fruit consumption [odds ratio (OR)(tertile 2), 0.60; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 0.38-0.95; OR(tertile 3), 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.95] and specifically increasing citrus fruit consumption (OR(tertile 2), 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.97; OR(tertile 3), 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.96). However, among the seropositive, risk increased with greater fruit consumption (OR(tertile 2), 2.27; 95\% CI, 0.92-5.58; OR(tertile 3), 1.40; 95\% CI, 0.55-3.59) and citrus fruit consumption (OR(tertile 2), 3.35; 95\% CI, 1.36, 8.24; OR(tertile 3), 3.15; 95\% CI, 1.23-8.08). This interaction was statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05), showing that fruit consumption was associated with a reduced HNSCC risk among HPV-16-seronegative individuals but an increased HNSCC risk among the HPV-16-seropositive individuals. These findings suggest that dietary factors dramatically alter the pattern of occurrence of HPV-associated HNSCC and show that viral-related disease is clinically and etiologically distinct.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Objective
              The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern has been shown to reduce cardiometabolic risk. Little is understood about the relationship between objective diet quality and perceived diet quality (PDQ), a potential psychosocial barrier to appropriate dietary intake. We compared PDQ and diet quality measured by a nutrient-based DASH index score in the USA.
            
            
              Design
              Cross-sectional study. Participants in the 2005–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) rated diet quality on a 5-point Likert scale and PDQ scores were generated (low, medium, high). A single 24 h dietary recall was used to estimate DASH index scores (range 0–9 points) by assigning 0, 0·5 or 1 point (optimal) for nine target nutrients: total fat, saturated fat, protein, cholesterol, fibre, Ca, Mg, K and Na.
            
            
              Setting
              Nationally representative sample of the US population.
            
            
              Subjects
              
                Adults aged ≥19 years in 2005–2006 NHANES (
                n
                4419).
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Participants with high PDQ (33 \%) had higher DASH index scores (mean 3·0 (
                sd
                0·07)) than those with low PDQ (mean 2·5 (
                sd
                0·06),
                P
                {\textless} 0·001), but average scores did not align with targets for intermediate or optimal DASH accordance. Adults with high PDQ reported higher total fat, saturated fat and Na intakes compared with optimal DASH nutrient goals. Differences between those with high
                v
                . low PDQ were similar for Whites and Blacks, but there was no difference between PDQ groups for Mexican Americans.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Among Whites and Blacks, but not Mexican Americans, high PDQ may be associated with higher diet quality, but not necessarily a diet meeting DASH nutrient goals. This disconnect between PDQ and actual diet quality may serve as a target in obesity prevention.},

Specifically, we combine the ridge penalty with the reduced rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to come up with a computationally straightforward algorithm. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms relevant competitors.

	abstract = {Abstract
            On March 11, 2011, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in the eastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of northern Japan. A resulting tsunami struck the Japan Pacific coast, causing {\textgreater}20,000 deaths, injuries and missing persons.
            Survivors’ post-tsunami health and nutritional status were surveyed one month after the disaster in a school shelter in Ishinomaki City. Hyogo College of Medicine's disaster relief team observations and survivors’ questionnaires were used to assess the disaster's effects on survivors’ lifestyles and gastrointestinal symptoms while residing in temporary shelters. Of 236 disaster evacuees 9-88 years of age (mean age 52 years), 23\% lost weight and 28\% reported decreased food intake one month after the earthquake. Up to 25\% of the participants presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation (10\%), appetite loss (6.4\%), vomiting (6.4\%), and nausea (2.1\%). Although the victims preferred more vegetables (44\%) or fruit (33\%), most food aid received, such as rice balls or bread, was carbohydrate-based, possibly because of easy provision and abundance in emergency food pantries. The authors asked the volunteers and the Japan Self-Defense Forces to provide a more balanced diet, including vegetables and fruit. Consumption of imbalanced diets may have caused more gastrointestinal symptoms for the survivors. Because of the victims’ hesitation to request more balanced diets, and because of poorly controlled existing chronic disease and mental stress, professional public health providers should assure emergency food nutrition after disasters.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malnutrition has been recognized as a poor prognostic indicator for cancer treatment-related morbidity and mortality in general, and it is reported to affect 30-50\% of all patients with head and neck cancer. In this study, the correlation of nutritional status with 3-year survival was studied prospectively in 64 patients with T2-T4 carcinomas of the head and neck who were treated surgically with curative intent; the surgery was often followed by radiotherapy.
METHODS: All patients underwent nutritional screening according to six different parameters on the day prior to surgery. Overall and disease specific survival analyses were performed with a follow-up period of at least 3 years. Survival analyses were performed with the log rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Lymph node stage, nonradical resection margins, and occurrence of major postoperative complications were demonstrated to affect disease specific survival for the group as a whole. None of the investigated nutritional parameters were correlated with survival. When men and women were analyzed separately, however, a preoperative weight loss of {\textgreater}5\% did have a prognostic value for men. The combination of male gender, preoperative weight loss, and major postoperative complications were related to early death.
CONCLUSIONS: Apart from the well-known prognostic parameters lymph node status (T classification) and status of surgical margins, preoperative weight loss and occurrence of major postoperative complications were also found to have a negative effect on the survival of male patients undergoing surgery for advanced head and neck cancer.},

Treatment selection bias occurs in a non-randomized study when treatment selection is based on pre-treatment characteristics that are also associated with the outcome. These pre-treatment characteristics, or confounders, can influence evaluation of a treatment's effect on the outcome. Propensity scores minimize this bias by balancing the known confounders between treatment groups. There are a few approaches to performing propensity score analyses, including stratifying by the propensity score, propensity matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Described here is the use of IPTW to balance baseline comorbidities in a cohort of patients within the US Military Health System Data Repository (MDR). The MDR is a relatively optimal data source, as it provides a contained cohort in which nearly complete information on inpatient and outpatient services is available for eligible beneficiaries. Outlined below is the use of the MDR supplemented with information from the national death index to provide robust mortality data. Also provided are suggestions for using administrative data. Finally, the protocol shares an SAS code for using IPTW to balance known confounders and plot the cumulative incidence function for the outcome of interest.},

              Background
              A low-carbohydrate diet may improve cancer survival, but relevant clinical evidence remains limited.
            
            
              Methods
              We followed 1542 stages I to III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire between 6 months and 4 years after diagnosis. We calculated overall, animal-, and plant-rich, low-carbohydrate diet scores and examined their associations with CRC-specific and overall mortality using Cox proportional hazards regression after adjusting for potential predictors for cancer survival. We also assessed the intake and changes of macronutrients after diagnosis. Statistical tests were two-sided.
            
            
              Results
              Although no association was found for overall and animal-rich low-carbohydrate diet score, plant-rich, low-carbohydrate diet, which emphasizes plant sources of fat and protein with moderate consumption of animal products, was associated with lower CRC-specific mortality (hazard ratio [HR] comparing extreme quartiles = 0.37, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25 to 0.57, Ptrend {\textless} .001). Carbohydrate intake was associated with higher CRC-specific mortality, and this association was restricted to carbohydrate consumed from refined starches and sugars (HR per one-SD increment = 1.36, 95\% CI = 1.14 to 1.62, Ptrend {\textless} .001). In contrast, replacing carbohydrate with plant fat and protein was associated with lower CRC-specific mortality, with the HR per one-SD increment of 0.81 (95\% CI = 0.69 to 0.95, Ptrend = .01) for plant fat and 0.77 (95\% CI = 0.62 to 0.95, Ptrend = .02) for plant protein. Similar results were obtained for overall mortality and when changes in macronutrient intake after diagnosis were assessed.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Plant-rich, low-carbohydrate diet score was associated with lower mortality in patients with nonmetastatic CRC. Substituting plant fat and protein for carbohydrate, particularly that from refined starches and sugars, may improve patients’ survival.},

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that base pair imperfectly to homologous regions in target mRNAs and negatively influence the synthesis of the corresponding proteins. Repression is mediated by a number of mechanisms, one of which is the direct inhibition of protein synthesis. Surprisingly, previous studies have suggested that two mutually exclusive mechanisms exist, one acting at the initiation phase of protein synthesis and the other at a postinitiation event. Here, we resolve this apparent dichotomy by demonstrating that the promoter used to transcribe the mRNA influences the type of miRNA-mediated translational repression. Transcripts derived from the SV40 promoter that contain let-7 target sites in their 3' UTRs are repressed at the initiation stage of translation, whereas essentially identical mRNAs derived from the TK promoter are repressed at a postinitiation step. We also show that there is a miR-34 target site within the 3' UTR of c-myc mRNA and that promoter dependency is also true for this endogenous 3' UTR. Overall, these data establish a link between the nuclear history of an mRNA and the mechanism of miRNA-mediated translational regulation in the cytoplasm.},

In recent years, several studies contributed to improve the knowledge of the pathophysiological alterations that lead to skeletal muscle dysfunction; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying sarcopenia are still not fully understood. Muscle development and homeostasis require a fine gene expression modulation by mechanisms in which microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role. miRNAs modulate key steps of skeletal myogenesis including satellite cells renewal, skeletal muscle plasticity, and regeneration. Here, we provide an overview of the general aspects of muscle regeneration and miRNAs role in skeletal mass homeostasis and plasticity with a special interest in their expression in sarcopenia and skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise in the elderly.},

Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility ({\textless}2.5\% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

A central component in this cascade is the kinase Akt, also called protein kinase B (PKB), which controls both protein synthesis, via the kinases mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and protein degradation, via the transcription factors of the FoxO family. In this paper, we review the composition and function of this pathway in skeletal muscle fibers, focusing on evidence obtained in vivo by transgenic and knockout models and by muscle transient transfection experiments. Although this pathway is essential for muscle growth during development and regeneration, its role in adult muscle response to mechanical load is less clear. A full understanding of the operation of this pathway could help to design molecularly targeted therapeutics aimed at preventing muscle wasting, which occurs in a variety of pathologic contexts and in the course of aging.},

	volume = {9},
	issn = {2190-6009},
	doi = {10.1002/jcsm.12296},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of muscle wasting is accompanied by benefits in other organs, possibly resulting from muscle-organ crosstalk. However, how the muscle communicates with these organs is less understood. Two microRNAs (miRs), miR-23a and miR-27a, are located together in a gene cluster and regulate proteins that are involved in the atrophy process. MiR-23a/27a has been shown to reduce muscle wasting and act as an anti-fibrotic agent. We hypothesized that intramuscular injection of miR-23a/27a would counteract both muscle wasting and renal fibrosis lesions in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic model.
METHODS: We generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that overexpresses the miR-23a∼27a∼24-2 precursor RNA and injected it into the tibialis anterior muscle of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Muscle cross-section area (immunohistology plus software measurement) and muscle function (grip strength) were used to evaluate muscle atrophy. Fibrosis-related proteins were measured by western blot to monitor renal damage. In some cases, AAV-GFP was used to mimic the miR movement in vivo, allowing us to track organ redistribution by using the Xtreme Imaging System.
RESULTS: The injection of AAV-miR-23a/27a increased the levels of miR-23a and miR-27a as well as increased phosphorylated Akt, attenuated the levels of FoxO1 and PTEN proteins, and reduced the abundance of TRIM63/MuRF1 and FBXO32/atrogin-1 in skeletal muscles. It also decreased myostatin mRNA and protein levels as well as the levels of phosphorylated pSMAD2/3. Provision of miR-23a/27a attenuates the diabetes-induced reduction of muscle cross-sectional area and muscle function. Curiously, the serum BUN of diabetic animals was reduced in mice undergoing the miR-23a/27a intervention. Renal fibrosis, evaluated by Masson trichromatic staining, was also decreased as were kidney levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3, alpha smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and collagen. In diabetic mice injected intramuscularly with AAV-GFP, GFP fluorescence levels in the kidneys showed linear correlation with the levels in injected muscle when examined by linear regression. Following intramuscular injection of AAV-miR-23a∼27a∼24-2, the levels of miR-23a and miR-27a in serum exosomes and kidney were significantly increased compared with samples from control virus-injected mice; however, no viral DNA was detected in the kidney.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that overexpression of miR-23a/27a in muscle prevents diabetes-induced muscle cachexia and attenuates renal fibrosis lesions via muscle-kidney crosstalk. Further, this crosstalk involves movement of miR potentially through muscle originated exosomes and serum distribution without movement of AAV. These results could provide new approaches for developing therapeutic strategies for diabetic nephropathy with muscle wasting.},

Determining whether there are independent effects of carbohydrate and protein on microRNA will allow for a clearer understanding of the mechanistic role microRNA serve in regulating skeletal muscle protein synthetic and proteolytic responses to nutrition and exercise. This study determined skeletal muscle microRNA responses to aerobic exercise with or without carbohydrate, and recovery whey protein (WP). Seventeen males were randomized to consume carbohydrate (CHO; 145 g; n = 9) or non-nutritive control (CON; n = 8) beverages during exercise. Muscle was collected before (BASE) and after 80 min of steady-state exercise (1.7 ± 0.3 V̇O2  L·min-1 ) followed by a 2-mile time trial (17.9 ± 3.5 min; POST), and 3-h into recovery after consuming WP (25 g; REC). RT-qPCR was used to determine microRNA and mRNA expression. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using the mirPath software. Western blotting was used to assess protein signaling. The expression of six microRNA (miR-19b-3p, miR-99a-5p, miR-100-5p, miR-222-3p, miR-324-3p, and miR-486-5p) were higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in CHO compared to CON, all of which target the PI3K-AKT, ubiquitin proteasome, FOXO, and mTORC1 pathways. p-AKTThr473 and p-FOXO1Thr24 were higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in POST CHO compared to CON. The expression of PTEN was lower (P {\textless} 0.05) in REC CHO than CON, while MURF1 was lower (P {\textless} 0.05) POST CHO than CON. These findings suggest the mechanism by which microRNA facilitate skeletal muscle adaptations in response to exercise with carbohydrate and protein feeding is by inhibiting markers of proteolysis.},

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence. Incidence data (through 2017) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31\%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long-term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one-half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1\% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5\% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8\% to 4.4\% in women, and from 2.4\% to 5\% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2\%-2.3\%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For example, NSCLC 2-year relative survival increased from 34\% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42\% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5\% to 6\% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14\% to 15\%. Improved treatment accelerated progress against lung cancer and drove a record drop in overall cancer mortality, despite slowing momentum for other common cancers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies regarding the association between dietary fiber intake and ovarian cancer risk are still inconsistent. We aimed to review the available evidence and conduct a dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and ovarian cancer risk.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases before August 2017. Studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between dietary fiber intake and risk of ovarian cancer were included. Random-effects models were used to combine the estimated effects extracted from individual study.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies, with a total of 5777 ovarian cancer cases and 142,189 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The pooled multivariable RRs of ovarian cancer for the highest vs. the lowest category of dietary fiber intake was 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.70, 0.88) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 4.20\%, P = 0.40). Our dose-response analysis also showed a significant inverse association between dietary fiber intake and ovarian cancer risk (an increment of 10 g/day; combined RR: 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.82, 0.93). There was no evidence for a nonlinear association (P for nonlinearity = 0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests a significant inverse dose-response association between dietary fiber intake and ovarian cancer risk. Further studies with prospective design that take account of more potential confounders are warranted to confirm this association.},

	doi = {10.1093/jnci/91.7.620},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a potent mitogen for normal and neoplastic cells, whereas IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) inhibits cell growth in many experimental systems. Acromegalics, who have abnormally high levels of growth hormone and IGF-I, have higher rates of colorectal cancer. We therefore examined associations of plasma levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 with the risk of colorectal cancer in a prospective case-control study nested in the Physicians' Health Study.
METHODS: Plasma samples were collected at baseline from 14916 men without diagnosed cancer. IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 were assayed among 193 men later diagnosed with colorectal cancer during 14 years of follow-up and among 318 age- and smoking-matched control subjects. All P values are two-sided.
RESULTS: IGFBP-3 levels correlated with IGF-I levels (r=.64) and with IGF-II levels (r=.90). After controlling for IGFBP-3, age, smoking, body mass index (weight in kg/[height in m]2), and alcohol intake, men in the highest quintile for IGF-I had an increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with men in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR]=2.51; 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-5.46; P for trend = .02). After controlling for IGF-I and other covariates, men with higher IGFBP-3 had a lower risk (RR=0.28; 95\% CI=0.12-0.66; P for trend = .005, comparing extreme quintiles). The associations were consistent during the first and the second 7-year follow-up intervals and among younger and older men. IGF-II was not associated with risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 are related to future risk of colorectal cancer.},

We searched for sociodemographic, anthropometric, reproductive, lifestyle, and dietary determinants of IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) -3 serum concentrations. Serum samples were collected in a Singapore Chinese cohort with a mean age of 61 years. Subject information was assessed during an in-person interview. Radioimmunometrically measured IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations were available for 312 men and 326 postmenopausal women ages 50 years or older. Mean IGF-I concentrations were 144 ng/ml and 121 ng/ml for men and women, respectively (gender difference, P {\textless} 0.0001), and mean IGFBP-3 concentrations were 3710 ng/ml and 4147 ng/ml for men and women, respectively (gender difference, P {\textless} 0.0001). IGF-I and IGFBP-3 decreased with age (P for trend {\textless}0.0001); the age-related decrease in the IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratio was stronger in women than men. IGF-I concentrations were higher among physically inactive subjects and among women with an early age at menarche. Consumption of saturated fat was found to decrease, and intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and of dietary fiber was found to increase circulating IGFBP-3 concentrations. Intake of calcium from food and supplement was associated positively with circulating IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and molar ratio. Intake of soy was associated positively with IGF-I and molar ratio concentrations, but only in men. The results of this study lend additional support to the hypothesis that circulating IGF-I concentrations increase the risk of prostate, bladder, colorectal, and breast cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) has been implicated in carcinogenesis, but there is no consensus regarding its involvement in ovarian cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between IR and ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Searches were conducted in five databases for studies evaluating IR markers (levels of serum insulin, C peptide, insulin growth factor [IGF] 1 and IGF-binding proteins [IGFBPs], homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance, and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index) and ovarian cancer risk. Study selection, data extraction and an assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by three researchers. The associations between IR markers and ovarian cancer were quantified as mean differences (MDs) or standardized MDs (SMDs) and their 95\% CIs using random-effects models.
RESULTS: Fourteen case-control studies satisfied our inclusion criteria (n=8130). There was little information on IR markers with the exception of the IGF system. Ovarian cancer was associated with lower IGF-1 levels (SMD -0.43ng/mL, 95\% CI -0.67 to -0.18; p=0.0006), and lower IGFBP-3 levels (SMD -0.11ng/mL, 95\% CI -0.21 to -0.00; p=0.04). However, ovarian cancer was associated with higher levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-1 (MD 527.3ng/mL, 95\%CI 473.6, 581.0; p{\textless}0.00001, and MD 3.47ng/mL, 95\%CI 1.42, 5.52; p=0.0009 respectively). Subgroup analyses by menopausal status and age (≤55 vs {\textgreater}55y) for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 showed the subgroups were similar, although heterogeneity remained high.
CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are lower in patients with ovarian cancer. In contrast, higher levels of IGBP-2 and IGBP-1 are found in patients with ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence supports a positive association between circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations and breast cancer risk, but both the magnitude and causality of this relationship are uncertain. We conducted observational analyses with adjustment for regression dilution bias, and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses allowed for causal inference.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the associations between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and incident breast cancer risk in 206 263 women in the UK Biobank. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. HRs were corrected for regression dilution using repeat IGF-1 measures available in a subsample of 6711 women. For the MR analyses, genetic variants associated with circulating IGF-1 and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels were identified and their association with breast cancer was examined with two-sample MR methods using genome-wide data from 122 977 cases and 105 974 controls.
RESULTS: In the UK Biobank, after a median follow-up of 7.1 years, 4360 incident breast cancer cases occurred. In the multivariable-adjusted models corrected for regression dilution, higher IGF-1 concentrations were associated with a greater risk of breast cancer (HR per 5 nmol/l increment of IGF-1 = 1.11, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.16). Similar positive associations were found by follow-up time, menopausal status, body mass index, and other risk factors. In the MR analyses, a 5 nmol/l increment in genetically-predicted IGF-1 concentration was associated with a greater breast cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.05, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.10; P = 0.02), with a similar effect estimate for estrogen-positive (ER+) tumours, but no effect found for estrogen-negative (ER-) tumours. Genetically-predicted IGFBP-3 concentrations were not associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratio per 1-standard deviation increment = 1.00, 95\% CI = 0.97-1.04; P = 0.98).
CONCLUSION: Our results support a probable causal relationship between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and breast cancer, suggesting that interventions targeting the IGF pathway may be beneficial in preventing breast tumorigenesis.},

Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations between baseline serum IGF-I concentrations and cancer incidence, using repeated IGF-I measurements from up to 14,149 participants to correct for regression dilution bias. Higher IGF-I concentration was associated with increased risks of thyroid cancer [HR per 5 nmol/L higher concentration 1.18; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.37] in addition to colorectal (HR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.13), breast (HR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.15), and prostate cancer (HR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.12), and reduced risks of ovarian and liver cancer. Mean follow-up was 6.9 years and the possibility that the observed associations may be influenced by reverse causality bias cannot be excluded. Additional nominally significant associations with malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, oral cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma did not survive correction for multiple testing. Studies with longer follow-up and pooled analyses are needed to further assess how broad the role of IGF-I is in cancer development. SIGNIFICANCE: The results from this outcome-wide analysis are consistent with a positive association of IGF-I with cancers at several sites.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Systemic inflammation may play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Few studies have comprehensively assessed the direct relations between dietary fiber and inflammatory cytokines, especially in minority populations. Using baseline data from 1958 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, we examined cross-sectional associations between dietary fiber intake and markers of systemic inflammation (including serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor-2 [TNF-alpha-R2]) in addition to differences in these associations by ethnicity.
METHODS: Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relation between fiber intake and makers of systemic inflammation.
RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, intakes of dietary fiber were inversely associated with IL-6 (P values for trend were 0.01 for total fiber, 0.004 for soluble fiber, and 0.001 for insoluble fiber) and TNF-alpha-R2 (P values for trend were 0.002 for total, 0.02 for soluble, and {\textless}0.001 for insoluble fibers). Although the samples were small in minority Americans, results were generally consistent with those found among European Americans. We did not observe any significant association between intake of dietary fiber and hs-CRP.
CONCLUSION: These findings lend support to the hypothesis that a high-fiber diet is associated with lower plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha-R2. Contrary to previous reports, however, there was no association between fiber and hs-CRP among postmenopausal women. Future studies on the influence of diet on inflammation should include IL-6 and TNF-alpha-R2 and enroll participants from ethnic minorities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of acute inflammation recently recognized as an independent predictor of future cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The identification of modifiable factors, such as diet, that influence serum CRP concentrations may provide the means for reducing the risk of these diseases. Data on longitudinal associations between dietary fiber intake and CRP are currently lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine longitudinal associations between dietary fiber intake and CRP.
DESIGN: Data collection took place at baseline and quarterly (every 13 wk) thereafter for a total of 5 visits, each including measurements of body composition, CRP, diet, and physical activity. Relations between serum CRP and dietary fiber were assessed by using linear mixed models and logistic regression, adjusted for covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 524 subjects had multiple measurements of CRP and dietary factors. The average total dietary fiber intake was 16.11 g/d. Average serum CRP was 1.78 mg/L. We observed an inverse association between intake of total dietary fiber (separately for soluble and insoluble fiber) and CRP concentrations in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The likelihood of elevated CRP concentrations was 63\% lower (OR: 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.16, 0.87) in participants in the highest quartile of total fiber intake than in participants in the lowest quartile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that dietary fiber is protective against high CRP, which supports current recommendations for a diet high in fiber.},

Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular, acetate beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and acetate production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant SCFA acetate and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral acetate administration (vinegar intake), colonic acetate infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities. Notably, human data are scarce, which highlights the necessity for further human research to investigate acetate's role in host physiology, metabolic, and cardiovascular health.},

METHODS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) to investigate dietary fiber and grain intake in relation to head and neck cancer.
RESULTS: During approximately 11 years of follow-up, 1,867 (401 women/1,466 men) cases of head and neck cancer were diagnosed. Our data indicated that the relationship between fiber and grain intake and head and neck cancer is modified by sex (p-interactions {\textless} 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Women with higher intake of total fiber and total grains had a lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR (10 g/day) = 0.77, 95\% CI = 0.64-0.93; HR (serving/1,000 kcal) = 0.89, 95\% CI = 0.80-0.99, respectively); this inverse relation was consistent across subtypes of fiber and grains. Conversely in men, the inverse associations were weaker and nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest prospective cohort study to investigate this relation to date, intake of total fiber and grain foods was inversely associated with head and neck cancer incidence among women, but not among men.},

Odds Ratios (ORs) and their 95\% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression applied to quintile categories of non-alcohol energy-adjusted fiber intake and adjusted for tobacco and alcohol use and other known or putative confounders. Fiber intake was inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer combined (OR for 5th vs. 1st quintile category = 0.49, 95\% CI: 0.40-0.59; p for trend {\textless}0.001) and with laryngeal cancer (OR = 0.66, 95\% CI: 0.54-0.82, p for trend {\textless}0.001). There was, however, appreciable heterogeneity of the estimated effect across studies for oral and pharyngeal cancer combined. Nonetheless, inverse associations were consistently observed for the subsites of oral and pharyngeal cancers and within most strata of the considered covariates, for both cancer sites. Our findings from a multicenter large-scale pooled analysis suggest that, although in the presence of between-study heterogeneity, a greater intake of fiber may lower HNC risk.},

	doi = {10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-03-0762},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Second primary tumors (SPTs) are a hallmark of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Serum levels of insulin growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) have been associated with subsequent development of several epithelial cancers in prospective studies.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To examine the role of IGFs in SPT development, we conducted a nested case-control study within a randomized, placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial in patients with early-stage HNSCC. We compared prediagnostic serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels in 80 patients who subsequently developed SPTs and 173 controls (patients without SPTs) matched to the cases on age (+/-5 years), sex, ethnicity, year of randomization, and length of follow-up.
RESULTS: The cases exhibited significantly higher levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 than did the controls (P = 0.001 and 0.019, respectively). Elevated IGF-I levels were associated with a 3.66-fold significantly increased risk of SPT. Lower and higher IGFBP-3 levels were associated with a 2.22- and 7.12-fold significant increased risk, respectively. The median SPT-free time was significantly shorter in patients with higher IGF-I levels than in patients with lower IGF-I levels (P {\textless} 0.0001). A similar trend was observed for IGFBP-3 (P = 0.002). Moreover, in the Cox proportional hazards model, higher IGF-I levels were significantly associated with increased risk of SPT with a hazard ratio of 2.78. Patients with the lower and higher IGFBP-3 levels also exhibited significantly increased risks with hazard ratios of 1.65 and 2.17, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating that higher IGF-I levels, and lower and higher IGFBP-3 levels are risk factors for SPT development. Thus, measuring serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels may be useful markers in assessing the risk of second tumors in patients successfully treated for their index cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A few papers have considered reproducibility of a posteriori dietary patterns across populations, as well as pattern associations with head and neck cancer risk when multiple populations are available.
METHODS: We used individual-level pooled data from seven case-control studies (3844 cases; 6824 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology consortium. We simultaneously derived shared and study-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-study factor analysis applied to 23 nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined, and larynx, from logistic regression models.
RESULTS: We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible across studies (75\% variance explained): the Antioxidant vitamins and fiber (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI = 0.41, 0.78, highest versus lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI = 0.67, 0.95) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk. The Animal products and cereals (OR = 1.5, 95\% CI = 1.1, 2.1) and the Fats (OR = 1.8, 95\% CI = 1.4, 2.3) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk, whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for the Antioxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additional study-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined. We named them all as Dairy products and breakfast cereals, and two were associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Multi-study factor analysis provides insight into pattern reproducibility and supports previous evidence on cross-country reproducibility of dietary patterns and on their association with head and neck cancer risk. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B430.},

RESULTS: We were able to identify four nutrient-derived patterns.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the association of diet and weight status with head and neck cancer outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether pretreatment dietary patterns and weight status are associated with head and neck cancer prognosis.
DESIGN: This was a longitudinal study of 542 patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer who completed food-frequency questionnaires and health surveys before treatment. Clinical data were abstracted from medical records and the Social Security Death Index. Dietary patterns were identified by using principal component analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association of derived dietary patterns (fit by quintiles of exposure) and weight status with time to recurrence and survival, with control for covariates.
RESULTS: During the study period, there were 229 deaths and 184 recurrences. Two dietary patterns were identified: a whole-foods pattern (characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and whole grains) and a Western pattern (characterized by high intakes of red and processed meats, refined grains, potatoes, and French fries). In multivariable analyses, significantly fewer deaths were observed in subjects most adherent to the whole-foods pattern (HR: 0.56; 95\% CI: 0.34, 0.92; P-trend = 0.01). Subjects classified as overweight or obese had significantly fewer deaths (HR: 0.65; 95\% CI: 0.49, 0.85; P = 0.001) and recurrences (HR: 0.70; 95\% CI: 0.52, 0.95; P = 0.02) than did normal-weight or underweight subjects.
CONCLUSION: Consumption of a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, fish, poultry, and whole grains and being overweight before diagnosis with head and neck cancer are associated with a better prognosis.},

	abstract = {The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) measures adherence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, but the association between the HEI-2005 and risk of chronic disease is not known. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), which is based on foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk, was associated inversely with chronic disease risk previously. We updated the AHEI, including additional dietary factors involved in the development of chronic disease, and assessed the associations between the AHEI-2010 and the HEI-2005 and risk of major chronic disease prospectively among 71,495 women from the Nurses' Health Study and 41,029 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were free of chronic disease at baseline. During ≥24 y of follow-up, we documented 26,759 and 15,558 incident chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or nontrauma death) among women and men, respectively. The RR (95\% CI) of chronic disease comparing the highest with the lowest quintile was 0.84 (0.81, 0.87) for the HEI-2005 and 0.81 (0.77, 0.85) for the AHEI-2010. The AHEI-2010 and HEI-2005 were most strongly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes, and for both outcomes the AHEI-2010 was more strongly associated with risk than the HEI-2005 (P-difference = 0.002 and {\textless}0.001, respectively). The 2 indices were similarly associated with risk of stroke and cancer. These findings suggest that closer adherence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines may lower risk of major chronic disease. However, the AHEI-2010, which included additional dietary information, was more strongly associated with chronic disease risk, particularly CHD and diabetes.},

	abstract = {Increased attention in dietary research and guidance has been focused on dietary patterns, rather than on single nutrients or food groups, because dietary components are consumed in combination and correlated with one another. However, the collective body of research on the topic has been hampered by the lack of consistency in methods used. We examined the relationships between 4 indices--the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010), the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED), and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)--and all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study (n = 492,823). Data from a 124-item food-frequency questionnaire were used to calculate scores; adjusted HRs and 95\% CIs were estimated. We documented 86,419 deaths, including 23,502 CVD- and 29,415 cancer-specific deaths, during 15 y of follow-up. Higher index scores were associated with a 12-28\% decreased risk of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality. Specifically, comparing the highest with the lowest quintile scores, adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality for men were as follows: HEI-2010 HR: 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76, 0.80), AHEI-2010 HR: 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74, 0.78), aMED HR: 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.75, 0.79), and DASH HR: 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.80, 0.85); for women, these were HEI-2010 HR: 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.74, 0.80), AHEI-2010 HR: 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74, 0.79), aMED HR: 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.73, 0.79), and DASH HR: 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.75, 0.81). Similarly, high adherence on each index was protective for CVD and cancer mortality examined separately. These findings indicate that multiple scores reflect core tenets of a healthy diet that may lower the risk of mortality outcomes, including federal guidance as operationalized in the HEI-2010, Harvard's Healthy Eating Plate as captured in the AHEI-2010, a Mediterranean diet as adapted in an Americanized aMED, and the DASH Eating Plan as included in the DASH score.},

When a time-varying confounder is affected by prior treatment standard methods for confounding control are inappropriate, because over time the covariate plays both the role of confounder and mediator of the effect of treatment on outcome. Marginal structural models first calculate a weight to assign to each observation. These weights reflect the extent to which observations with certain characteristics (covariate values) are under-represented or over-represented in the sample with the respect to a target population in which these characteristics are balanced across treatment groups. Then, marginal structural models estimate the outcome of interest taking into account these weights. Marginal structural models are a powerful method for confounding control in longitudinal study designs that collect time-varying information on exposure, outcome and other covariates.},

The bacteria are responsible for the two commonest bacterial diseases of man: dental caries (tooth decay) and the periodontal (gum) diseases. Archaea are restricted to a small number of species of methanogens while around 1000 bacterial species have been found, with representatives from the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes and Tenericutes and the uncultured divisions GN02, SR1 and TM7. Around half of oral bacteria are as yet uncultured and culture-independent methods have been successfully used to comprehensively describe the oral bacterial community. The human oral microbiome database (HOMD, www.homd.org) provides a comprehensive resource consisting of descriptions of oral bacterial taxa, a 16S rRNA identification tool and a repository of oral bacterial genome sequences. Individuals' oral microbiomes are highly specific at the species level, although overall the human oral microbiome shows few geographical differences. Although caries and periodontitis are clearly bacterial diseases, they are not infectious diseases in the classical sense because they result from a complex interaction between the commensal microbiota, host susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and smoking. Periodontitis, in particular, appears to result from an inappropriate inflammatory reaction to the normal microbiota, exacerbated by the presence of some disease-associated bacterial species. In functional terms, there appears to considerable redundancy among the oral microbiota and a focus on functional rather than phylogenetic diversity may be required in order to fully understand host-microbiome interactions.},

	abstract = {Circulating nitrate (NO(3)(-)), derived from dietary sources or endogenous nitric oxide production, is extracted from blood by the salivary glands, accumulates in saliva, and is then reduced to nitrite (NO(2)(-)) by the oral microflora. This process has historically been viewed as harmful, because nitrite can promote formation of potentially carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. More recent research, however, suggests that nitrite can also serve as a precursor for systemic generation of vasodilatory nitric oxide, and exogenous administration of nitrate reduces blood pressure in humans. However, whether oral nitrate-reducing bacteria participate in "setting" blood pressure is unknown. We investigated whether suppression of the oral microflora affects systemic nitrite levels and hence blood pressure in healthy individuals. We measured blood pressure (clinic, home, and 24-h ambulatory) in 19 healthy volunteers during an initial 7-day control period followed by a 7-day treatment period with a chlorhexidine-based antiseptic mouthwash. Oral nitrate-reducing capacity and nitrite levels were measured after each study period. Antiseptic mouthwash treatment reduced oral nitrite production by 90\% (p {\textless} 0.001) and plasma nitrite levels by 25\% (p = 0.001) compared to the control period. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by 2-3 .5mmHg, increases correlated to a decrease in circulating nitrite concentrations (r(2) = 0.56, p = 0.002). The blood pressure effect appeared within 1 day of disruption of the oral microflora and was sustained during the 7-day mouthwash intervention. These results suggest that the recycling of endogenous nitrate by oral bacteria plays an important role in determination of plasma nitrite levels and thereby in the physiological control of blood pressure.},

A secondary aim was to determine whether dietary nitrate increases the formation of protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine in plasma, and if dietary nitrate improves platelet function. The pharmacokinetic profile of urinary nitrate excretion indicates total clearance of consumed nitrate in a 24 h period. While urinary, salivary, and plasma nitrate concentrations increased between 4- and 7-fold, a significant increase in nitrite was only detected in saliva (7-fold).

Nitrate is an ecological factor that can induce rapid changes in structure and function of polymicrobial communities, but the effects on the oral microbiota have not been clarified. To test this, saliva of 12 healthy donors was collected to grow in vitro biofilms with and without 6.5 mM nitrate. Samples were taken at 5 h (most nitrate reduced) and 9 h (all nitrate reduced) of biofilm formation for ammonium, lactate and pH measurements, as well as 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. Nitrate did not affect biofilm growth significantly, but reduced lactate production, while increasing the observed ammonium production and pH (all p {\textless} 0.01). Significantly higher levels of the oral health-associated nitrate-reducing genera Neisseria (3.1 ×) and Rothia (2.9 ×) were detected in the nitrate condition already after 5 h (both p {\textless} 0.01), while several caries-associated genera (Streptococcus, Veillonella and Oribacterium) and halitosis- and periodontitis-associated genera (Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia, Prevotella, and Alloprevotella) were significantly reduced (p {\textless} 0.05 at 5 h and/or 9 h). In conclusion, the addition of nitrate to oral communities led to rapid modulation of microbiome composition and activity that could be beneficial for the host (i.e., increasing eubiosis or decreasing dysbiosis).

Therefore, we aimed to clarify the detailed information about the bacterial NO2-production in the oral biofilm. Dental plaque and tongue-coating samples were collected, then the NO2-producing activity was measured. Furthermore, the composition of the NO2--producing bacterial population were identified using the Griess reagent-containing agar overlay method and molecular biological method. NO2--producing activity per mg wet weight varied among individuals but was higher in dental plaque. Additionally, anaerobic bacteria exhibited higher numbers of NO2--producing bacteria, except in the adults' dental plaque. The proportion of NO2--producing bacteria also varied among individuals, but a positive correlation was found between NO2--producing activity and the number of NO2--producing bacteria, especially in dental plaque. Overall, the major NO2--producing bacteria were identified as Actinomyces, Schaalia, Veillonella and Neisseria. Furthermore, Rothia was specifically detected in the tongue coatings of children. These results suggest that dental plaque has higher NO2--producing activity and that this activity depends not on the presence of specific bacteria or the bacterial compositions, but on the number of NO2--producing bacteria, although interindividual differences were detected.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite many potential effects of the oral microbiome on oral and systemic health, scant information is available regarding the associations between diet and the oral microbiome.
METHODS: Oral rinse DNA samples from 182 participants in a population-based case-control study for colorectal cancer were used to amplify a V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq paired end chemistry on 2 runs, yielding approximately 33 million filtered reads that were assigned to bacterial classes. Relative abundances of each class and family as well microbial diversity/richness indices were correlated with selected dietary intakes from a food frequency questionnaire.
RESULTS: Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and vitamin C intakes were consistently correlated with alpha (within-subjects) diversity indexes in both richness and diversity. SFA intake was positively correlated with relative abundance of betaproteobacteria and fusobacteria. Vitamin C and other vitamins with correlated intakes-for example, the B vitamins and vitamin E-exhibited positive correlations with fusobacteria class, its family Leptotrichiaceae and a clostridia family Lachnospiraceae. In addition, glycemic load was positively correlated with Lactobacillaceae abundance.
CONCLUSION: The observed associations in this study were modest. However, the results suggest that the effects of diets are likely to be habitat specific, and observations from the gut microbiome are not transferrable to the oral microbiome. Further studies are warranted, incorporating a range of host biomarkers, such as cytohistological, molecular, or biochemical measurements, in order to address biological consequences of these dietary intakes in human oral health.},

High-throughput genetic-based assays now make it possible to comprehensively survey the human oral microbiome, the totality of bacteria in the oral cavity. Establishing the association of the oral microbiome with cancer risk may lead to significant advances in understanding of cancer etiology, potentially opening a new research paradigm for cancer prevention.},

	abstract = {An altered oral microbiota has been linked with the development of several oral diseases, such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral stomatitis. Moreover, poor oral health has been linked to head and neck cancer, particularly oral cancer. In recent years a growing number of studies indicate that oral microbiota could be involved in the development of primary tumours outside of head and neck region. The aim of this article is to review the recent studies based on high-throughput technology to present evidences of a relationship between oral microbiota and "non-head and neck tumours." Oral dysbiosis seem to be more pronounced in patients with tumours of gastrointestinal tract, in particular oesophageal, gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers, paving the way for developing specific oral microbiota test to allow early cancer detection. Regarding other tumour types, the results are promising but highly preliminary and still debated. Currently, there are several factors that limit the generalization of the results, such as the small sample size, the lack of adequate clinical information about patients, the different sequencing techniques used, and biological sample heterogeneity. Although only at the beginning, the analysis of oral microbiota could be the next step in the evolution of cancer therapy and will help clinicians to develop individualised approaches to cancer prevention and treatment.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological data from Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand indicate that a substantial proportion of foodborne disease is attributable to improper food preparation practices in consumers' homes. International concern about consumer food safety has prompted considerable research to evaluate domestic food-handling practices. The majority of consumer food safety studies in the last decade have been conducted in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland (48\%) and in the United States (42\%). Surveys (questionnaires and interviews), the most frequent means of data collection, were used in 75\% of the reviewed studies. Focus groups and observational studies have also been used. One consumer food safety study examined the relationship between pathogenic microbial contamination from raw chicken and observed food-handling behaviors, and the results of this study indicated extensive Campylobacter cross-contamination during food preparation sessions. Limited information about consumers' attitudes and intentions with regard to safe food-handling behaviors has been obtained, although a substantial amount of information about consumer knowledge and self-reported practices is available. Observation studies suggest that substantial numbers of consumers frequently implement unsafe food-handling practices. Knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and self-reported practices did not correspond to observed behaviors, suggesting that observational studies provide a more realistic indication of the food hygiene actions actually used in domestic food preparation. An improvement in consumer food-handling behavior is likely to reduce the risk and incidence of foodborne disease. The need for the development and implementation of food safety education strategies to improve specific food safety behaviors is reviewed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Interorgan amino acid transport is a highly active and regulated process that provides amino acids to all tissues of the body, both for protein synthesis and to enable amino acids to be used for specific metabolic functions. It is also an important component of plasma amino acid homeostasis. Net movement of amino acids depends on the physiological and nutritional state. For example, in the fed state the dominant flux is from the intestine to the other tissues. In starvation the dominant flux is from muscle to the liver and kidney. A number of general principles underlie many amino acid fluxes: i) The body does not have a store for amino acids. This means that dietary amino acids, in excess of those required for protein synthesis, are rapidly catabolized; ii) Amino acid catabolism must occur in a manner that does not elevate blood ammonia. Thus, extrasplanchnic amino acid metabolism often involves an innocuous means of transporting nitrogen to the liver; iii) Because most amino acids are glucogenic, there will be a considerable flux of amino acids to the gluconeogenic organs when there is a need to produce glucose. In addition to these bulk flows, fluxes of many specific amino acids underlie specific organ function. These include intestinal oxidation of enteral amino acids, the intestinal/renal axis for arginine production, the brain uptake of neurotransmitter precursors and renal glutamine metabolism. There is no single means of regulating amino acid fluxes; rather, such varied mechanisms as substrate supply, enzyme activity, transporter activity and competitive inhibition of transport are all found.},

Physiological conditions which result in eIF2 alpha phosphorylation include virus infection, heat shock, iron deficiency, nutrient deprivation, changes in intracellular calcium, accumulation of unfolded or denatured proteins and the induction of apoptosis. Phosphorylated eIF2 acts as a dominant inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and prevents the recycling of eIF2 between successive rounds of protein synthesis. Extensive phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha and strong inhibition of eIF2B activity can result in the downregulation of the overall rate of protein synthesis; less marked changes may lead to alterations in the selective translation of alternative open reading frames in polycistronic mRNAs, as demonstrated in yeast. These mechanisms can provide a signal transduction pathway linking eukaryotic cellular stress responses to alterations in the control of gene expression at the translational level.},

GCN2's function in mammals is unknown, but must differ, since mammals, unlike yeast, can synthesize only half of the standard 20 amino acids. To investigate the function of mammalian GCN2, we have generated a Gcn2(-/-) knockout strain of mice. Gcn2(-/-) mice are viable, fertile, and exhibit no phenotypic abnormalities under standard growth conditions. However, prenatal and neonatal mortalities are significantly increased in Gcn2(-/-) mice whose mothers were reared on leucine-, tryptophan-, or glycine-deficient diets during gestation. Leucine deprivation produced the most pronounced effect, with a 63\% reduction in the expected number of viable neonatal mice. Cultured embryonic stem cells derived from Gcn2(-/-) mice failed to show the normal induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in cells deprived of leucine. To assess the biochemical effects of the loss of GCN2 in the whole animal, liver perfusion experiments were conducted. Histidine limitation in the presence of histidinol induced a twofold increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and a concomitant reduction in eIF2B activity in perfused livers from wild-type mice, but no changes in livers from Gcn2(-/-) mice.},

	abstract = {eIF2B is a heteropentameric guanine-nucleotide exchange factor essential for protein synthesis initiation in eukaryotes. Its activity is inhibited in response to starvation or stress by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of its substrate, translation initiation factor eIF2, resulting in reduced rates of translation and cell growth. We have used an in vitro nucleotide-exchange assay to show that wild-type yeast eIF2B is inhibited by phosphorylated eIF2 [eIF2(alphaP)] and to characterize eIF2B regulatory mutations that render translation initiation insensitive to eIF2 phosphorylation in vivo. Unlike wild-type eIF2B, eIF2B complexes with mutated GCN3 or GCD7 subunits efficiently catalyzed GDP exchange using eIF2(alphaP) as a substrate. Using an affinity-binding assay, we show that an eIF2B subcomplex of the GCN3, GCD7, and GCD2 subunits binds to eIF2 and has a higher affinity for eIF2(alphaP), but it lacks nucleotide-exchange activity. In contrast, the GCD1 and GCD6 subunits form an eIF2B subcomplex that binds equally to eIF2 and eIF2(alphaP). Remarkably, this second subcomplex has higher nucleotide-exchange activity than wild-type eIF2B that is not inhibited by eIF2(alphaP). The identification of regulatory and catalytic eIF2B subcomplexes leads us to propose that binding of eIF2(alphaP) to the regulatory subcomplex prevents a productive interaction with the catalytic subcomplex, thereby inhibiting nucleotide exchange.},

	volume = {7},
	issn = {1052-2166},
	abstract = {The purpose of this review is to discuss ATF3, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, and its roles in stress responses. In the introduction, we briefly describe the ATF/CREB family, which contains more than 10 proteins with the basic region-leucine zipper (bZip) DNA binding domain. We summarize their DNA binding and heterodimer formation with other bZip proteins, and discuss the nomenclature of these proteins. Over the years, identical or homologous cDNA clones have been isolated by different laboratories and given different names. We group these proteins into subgroups according to their amino acid similarity; we also list the alternative names for each member, and clarify some potential confusion in the nomenclature of this family of proteins. We then focus on ATF3 and its potential roles in stress responses. We review the evidence that the mRNA level of ATF3 greatly increases when the cells are exposed to stress signals. In animal experiments, the signals include ischemia, ischemia coupled with reperfusion, wounding, axotomy, toxicity, and seizure; in cultured cells, the signals include serum factors, cytokines, genotoxic agents, cell death-inducing agents, and the adenoviral protein E1A. Despite the overwhelming evidence for its induction by stress signals, not much else is known about ATF3. Preliminary results suggest that the JNK/SAPK pathway is involved in the induction of ATF3 by stress signals; in addition, IL-6 and p53 have been demonstrated to be required for the induction of ATF3 under certain conditions. The consequences of inducing ATF3 during stress responses are not clear. Transient transfection and in vitro transcription assays indicate that ATF3 represses transcription as a homodimer; however, ATF3 can activate transcription when coexpressed with its heterodimeric partners or other proteins. Therefore, it is possible that, when induced during stress responses, ATF3 activates some target genes but represses others, depending on the promoter context and cellular context. Even less is understood about the physiological significance of inducing ATF3. We will discuss our preliminary results and some reports by other investigators in this regard.},

Based on these observations, oligophrenia phenylpyrouvica (later termed phenylketonuria) was described as a new inborn error of metabolism. Følling later showed the pattern of an autosomal recessive genetic disease, probably caused by a block in phenylalanine metabolism, and that asymptomatic heterozygote carriers of the trait could be detected by phenylalanine loading. The stepwise elucidation and the line of reasoning are described. Phenylketonuria was the first inborn error of metabolism shown to affect the mind, and its importance as a model disease is emphasized.

Deficiency of this enzyme results in phenylketonuria, a common genetic disorder of amino acid metabolism that causes severe mental retardation. In primates, PAH is expressed specifically in the liver, while in rodents PAH activity is also present in kidney, although at a much lower level. A 9-kilobase genomic DNA fragment at the 5' end of the hPAH gene (hPAH) was fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. The hPAH/CAT minigene was used to generate multiple transgenic mouse lines. In all expressing lines, CAT activity was detected predominantly in the liver and at much lower levels in the kidney. By immunohistochemical staining, CAT expression was localized to hepatocytes and renal epithelial cells, both of which also express the endogenous mouse PAH enzyme. Furthermore, both the transgene and the endogenous mouse PAH were activated at about the same stage of embryonic development in the mouse liver. These results suggest that the 9-kilobase DNA fragment flanking the 5' end of the human PAH gene contains all the necessary cis-acting elements to direct tissue- and developmental-specific expression in vivo.},

	abstract = {Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in intolerance to the dietary intake of the essential amino acid phenylalanine. It occurs in approximately 1:15,000 individuals. Deficiency of this enzyme produces a spectrum of disorders including classic phenylketonuria, mild phenylketonuria, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia. Classic phenylketonuria is caused by a complete or near-complete deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and without dietary restriction of phenylalanine most children will develop profound and irreversible intellectual disability. Mild phenylketonuria and mild hyperphenylalaninemia are associated with lower risk of impaired cognitive development in the absence of treatment. Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency can be diagnosed by newborn screening based on detection of the presence of hyperphenylalaninemia using the Guthrie microbial inhibition assay or other assays on a blood spot obtained from a heel prick. Since the introduction of newborn screening, the major neurologic consequences of hyperphenylalaninemia have been largely eradicated. Affected individuals can lead normal lives. However, recent data suggest that homeostasis is not fully restored with current therapy. Treated individuals have a higher incidence of neuropsychological problems. The mainstay of treatment for hyperphenylalaninemia involves a low-protein diet and use of a phenylalanine-free medical formula. This treatment must commence as soon as possible after birth and should continue for life. Regular monitoring of plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations is necessary. Targets of plasma phenylalanine of 120-360 μmol/L (2-6 mg/dL) in the first decade of life are essential for optimal outcome. Phenylalanine targets in adolescence and adulthood are less clear. A significant proportion of patients with phenylketonuria may benefit from adjuvant therapy with 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin stereoisomer. Special consideration must be given to adult women with hyperphenylalaninemia because of the teratogenic effects of phenylalanine. Women with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency considering pregnancy should follow special guidelines and assure adequate energy intake with the proper proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates to minimize risks to the developing fetus. Molecular genetic testing of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene is available for genetic counseling purposes to determine carrier status of at-risk relatives and for prenatal testing.},

Neuroimaging studies demonstrate high-signal intensity in the periventricular white matter in most PKU patients, which can extend into subcortical and frontal regions in more severe cases. A review of histopathology and neuroimaging studies reveals that diffuse white matter pathology in untreated PKU patients is likely to reflect hypomyelination (lack of myelin formation), while in early-treated patients white matter abnormalities observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is likely to reflect intramyelinic edema. Research demonstrates that this pathology is associated with metabolic control and may be reversed with adherence to a strict low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet. While the functional significance of white matter pathology in PKU is not certain, there is some evidence that these abnormalities are associated with functional impairments when the pathology extends into subcortical and frontal regions.},

To validate the data obtained from this trial, a short-term double-blind placebo control study was done using LNAA in patients with PKU, with the participation of three additional metabolic centres--Milan, Padua and Rio de Janeiro. The results of the short trial showed significant lowering of blood Phe concentration by an average of 39\% from baseline. The data from the double-blind placebo control are encouraging, establishing proof of principle of the role of orally administered LNAA in lowering blood Phe concentrations in patients with PKU.

	abstract = {Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency and is associated with systemic accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe). Previously we demonstrated correction of murine PKU after intravenous injection of a recombinant type 2 adeno-associated viral vector pseudotyped with type 8 capsid (rAAV2/8), which successfully directed hepatic transduction and Pah gene expression. Here, we report that liver PAH activity and phenylalanine clearance were also restored in PAH-deficient mice after simple intramuscular injection of either AAV2 pseudotype 1 (rAAV2/1) or rAAV2/8 vectors. Serotype 2 AAV vector (rAAV2/2) was also investigated, but long-term phenylalanine clearance has been observed only for pseudotypes 1 and 8. Therapeutic correction was shown in both male and female mice, albeit more effectively in males, in which correction lasted for the entire period of the experiment ({\textgreater}1 year). Although phenylalanine levels began to rise in female mice at about 8-10 months after rAAV2/8 injection they remained only mildly hyperphenylalaninemic thereafter and subsequent supplementation with synthetic tetrahydrobiopterin resulted in a transient decrease in blood phenylalanine. Alternatively, subsequent administration of a second vector with a different AAV pseudotype to avoid immunity against the previously administrated vector was also successful for long-term treatment of female PKU mice. Overall, this relatively less invasive gene transfer approach completes our previous studies and allows comparison of complementary strategies in the development of efficient PKU gene therapy protocols.},

	abstract = {This study examined potential mechanisms contributing to the inhibition of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and heart after administration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Rats had vascular catheters implanted, and TNF-alpha was infused continuously for 24 h. TNF-alpha decreased in vivo-determined rates of global protein synthesis in gastrocnemius (39\%) and heart (25\%). The TNF-alpha-induced decrease in protein synthesis in the gastrocnemius involved a reduction in the synthesis of both myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins. To identify potential mechanisms responsible for regulating mRNA translation, we examined several eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and elongation factors (eEFs). TNF-alpha decreased the activity of eIF-2B in muscle (39\%) but not in heart. This diminished activity was not caused by a reduction in the content of eIF-2B epsilon or the content and phosphorylation state of eIF-2 alpha. Skeletal muscle and heart from TNF-alpha-treated rats demonstrated 1) an increased binding of the translation repressor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) with eIF-4E, 2) a decreased amount of eIF-4E associated with eIF-4G, and 3) a decreased content of the hyperphosphorylated gamma-form of 4E-BP1. In contrast, the infusion of TNF-alpha did not alter the content of eEF-1 alpha or eEF-2, or the phosphorylation state of eEF-2. In summary, these data suggest that TNF-alpha impairs skeletal muscle and heart protein synthesis, at least in part, by decreasing mRNA translational efficiency resulting from an impairment in translation initiation associated with alterations in eIF-4E availability.},

This study aimed to identify the specific proteolytic pathways activated in skeletal muscles of cirrhotic rats. TNF-α can stimulate muscle proteolysis; therefore, a potential relationship between TNF-α and muscle wasting in liver cirrhosis was also evaluated. Cirrhosis was induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in male adult Sprague-Dawley rats. mRNA and protein levels of various targets were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The proteolytic rate was measured ex vivo using isolated muscles. Compared with sham-operated controls, BDL rats had an increased degradation rate of muscle proteins and enhanced gene expression of ubiquitin, 14-kDa ubiquitin carrier protein E2, and the proteasome subunits C2 and C8 ( P {\textless} 0.01). The muscle protein levels of free ubiquitin and conjugated ubiquitin levels were also elevated ( P {\textless} 0.01). However, there was no difference between the two groups with regard to cathepsin and calpain mRNA levels. Cirrhotic muscle TNF-α levels were increased and correlated positively with free and conjugated ubiquitin ( P {\textless} 0.01). We conclude that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in muscle wasting of rats with BDL-induced cirrhosis. TNF-α might play a role in mediating activation of this proteolytic pathway, probably through a local mechanism.},

	abstract = {Wasting of skeletal muscle protein is a prominent feature of the metabolic response to sepsis. Persistent protein wasting leads to muscle dysfunction and prolongs recovery from the septic insult. Unfortunately, conventional nutritional support alone does not prevent the sepsis-induced weight loss and catabolism of muscle. Hence, mechanisms other than substrate deficiency appear to be involved in the derangements in protein metabolism during sepsis. The catabolism of muscle during sepsis results from a stimulation of proteolysis and an inhibition of protein synthesis. Despite the importance of these pathways in maintaining muscle mass, the regulation of protein synthesis and proteolysis during sepsis remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the mechanisms responsible for alterations in protein synthesis and degradation in muscle during sepsis at the biochemical level. The ability of hormones (insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, glucocorticoids) or cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1) to act as mediators or modulators of protein catabolism is also examined. A picture is emerging suggesting that cytokines may influence skeletal muscle protein metabolism during sepsis both indirectly, through inhibition of the regulatory actions of anabolic hormones on protein turnover, and directly, through modulation of the protein synthesis and degradation enzymatic machinery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To obtain optimal protein requirements in critically ill sepsis or trauma patients during the first 2 wks after admission to the intensive care unit.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Department of critical care medicine at a teaching hospital.
PATIENTS: Immediate posttrauma patients or severely septic patients.
INTERVENTIONS: In vivo neutron activation analysis was used to measure changes in total body protein over a 10-day period which began as soon as the patients were hemodynamically stable. The patients (trauma, n=18; sepsis, n=5) were divided into three groups according to the average daily protein intakes. Because the patients were overhydrated (approximately 10 L) and had variable amounts of body fat, the protein intakes were indexed to normally hydrated (corrected) fat-free mass (FFMc): Groups A, B, and C received an average of 1.1, 1.5, and 1.9 g/kg FFMc/day protein, respectively.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, the average loss of total body protein was 1.2=0.7 (SD) kg. Changes in total body protein were significantly (p=.011) different between the three groups. The loss of body protein was significantly more in group A compared with groups B (p=.013) and C (p=.023). When the protein intake was increased from 1.1 g/kg FFMc/day to 1.5 g/kg FFMc/day, protein loss was halved. Further increase in protein intake up to 1.9 g/kg FFMc/day resulted in no further improvement. An intake of 1.5 g/kg FFMc/day was equivalent to 1.0 g/day/kg of body weight measured at the beginning of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Current recommended protein requirements of 1.2 to 2.0 g/kg of body weight/day are excessive if they are indexed to the body weight measured soon after the onset of critical illness. Because individual patients have varying degrees of overhydration early in the illness onset, we suggest that the intensivist should obtain information on preillness body weight and prescribe 1.2g of protein/kg body weight/day. If information is not available, 1.0g of protein/day/kg of measured body weight will give a fair approximation to optimal protein requirements.},

Acidosis may be a result of the underlying pathophysiology, but it also may be the result of the way in which those patients are managed. Chloride-associated acidosis is frequent and is potentially aggravated during fluid resuscitation. The severity of metabolic acidosis is associated with poor clinical outcomes; however, it remains uncertain whether or not there is a causal relationship between acidosis and the pathophysiology of septic syndromes. Several experimental findings have demonstrated the impact of acidosis modulation on the release of inflammatory mediators and cardiovascular function. Treatment of metabolic acidosis is based on control of the underlying process and support of organ dysfunction, although the use of intravenous chloride-poor balanced solutions seems an attractive option to prevent the worsening of metabolic acidosis during fluid resuscitation.},

Mixed muscle fractional synthesis rate (FSR) increased significantly at 10 min POST-EX in both the younger (0.0363\%/h) and older men (0.0830\%/h), with the younger men staying elevated through 60 min POST-EX (0.0253\%/h). ALB FSR increased at 10 min POST-EX in the younger men only (2.30\%/day), whereas FIB FSR was elevated in both groups through 180 min POST-EX (younger men = 4.149, older men = 4.107\%/day). Muscle protein turnover was also increased, with increases in synthesis and breakdown in younger and older men. Phe rate of disappearance (synthesis) was increased in both groups at 10 min POST-EX and remained elevated through 60 min POST-EX in the older men. A bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise induces short-term increases in muscle and plasma protein synthesis in both younger and older men. Aging per se does not diminish the protein metabolic capacity of the elderly to respond to acute aerobic exercise.},

Primed constant infusions of [1,2-13C]-leucine and [15N]glycine enabled the quantitation of whole body protein turnover and also the fractional synthetic rates (FSR) of albumin, fibrinogen, and fibronectin. In subjects who did not exercise, the fractional synthetic rates (\%/day) on normal and high-protein intakes, respectively, were as follows: albumin, 10 +/- 1 and 9 +/- 1; fibrinogen, 21 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 1; and fibronectin, 31 +/- 3 and 34 +/- 3. Neither exercise nor recovery had an effect of whole body protein turnover or on albumin FSR, but the FSR of fibronectin was significantly elevated at the end of exercise, and fibrinogen was significantly elevated in recovery. Dietary protein intake had no major effect on the response to exercise. Thus, in response to exercise, there is a stimulation of the synthesis of some acute phase proteins, which may be a mechanism whereby nitrogen resulting from muscle protein breakdown is spared.},

Therefore, in this study we have measured the rate of muscle protein synthesis in normal volunteers at rest, at the end of 4 h of aerobic exercise (40\% maximal O2 consumption), and after 4 h of recovery by determining directly the rate of incorporation of 1,2-[13C]leucine into muscle. The rate of muscle protein breakdown was assessed by 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) excretion, and total urinary nitrogen excretion was also measured. There was an insignificant increase in 3-MH excretion in exercise of 37\% and a significant increase (P less than 0.05) of 85\% during 4 h of recovery from exercise (0.079 +/- 0.008 vs. 0.147 +/- 0.0338 mumol.kg-1.min-1 for rest and recovery from exercise, respectively). Nonetheless, there was no effect of exercise on total nitrogen excretion. Muscle fractional synthetic rate was not different in the exercise vs. the control group at the end of exercise (0.0417 +/- 0.004 vs. 0.0477 +/- 0.010\%/h for exercise vs. control), but there was a significant increase in fractional synthetic rate in the exercise group during the recovery period (0.0821 +/- 0.006 vs. 0.0654 +/- 0.012\%/h for exercise vs. control, P less than 0.05). Thus we conclude that although aerobic exercise may stimulate muscle protein breakdown, this does not result in a significant depletion of muscle mass because muscle protein synthesis is stimulated in recovery.},

METHODS: Blood samples of 11 participants were obtained for standard analysis before, immediately after, two days after and nine days after the 2002 International Ultra-marathon 24 h Race and the International Association of Ultrarunners (IAU) Asia 24 h Championship.
RESULTS: Total bilirubin (BIL-T), direct bilirubin (BIL-D), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased statistically significantly (P{\textless}0.05) the race. Significant declines (P{\textless}0.05) in red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) were detected two days and nine days d after the race. 2 d after the race, total protein (TP), concentration of albumin and globulin decreased significantly. While BIL, BIL-D and ALP recovered to their original levels. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) remained unchanged immediately after the race, but it was significantly decreased on the second and ninth days after the race.
CONCLUSION: Ultra-marathon running is associated with a wide range of significant changes in hematological parameters, several of which are injury related. To provide appropriate health care and intervention, the man who receives athletes on high frequent training program high intensity training programs must monitor their liver and gallbladder function.},

The principle physiological functions of glucocorticoids are stimulation of gluconeogenesis and mobilization of amino acids and fatty acids from body stores. 2. Injected glucocorticoids produce significant increases in the work produced by isolated muscle and by intact animals. 3. Light to moderate exercise work loads may produce an increase, decrease or no change in plasma glucocorticoid (GC) levels; depending on the degree of psychological and/or physiological stress involved in the exercise. 4. In moderate to exhaustive exercise the plasma GC levels progressively increase. In some subjects (especially animals) exhaustion produces a decrease in plasma GC which may represent a defense mechanism to prevent depletion of body resources. 5. Chronic exercise training produces adrenal cortex hypertrophy and usually a smaller rise in plasma GC during an acute exercise bout than that obtained with nontrained subjects. The resting GC levels frequently increase initially during training but return to normal as the trained state is reached. 6. The changes in GC response during training appear to be produced by decreased responsiveness of the adrenal cortex itself to ACTH stimulation and possibly by adaptation of the hypothalamus-hypophysis axis which reduces the ACTH released in response to stress. 7. The many combinations of psychological and physiological stress present in different exercise regimens probably account for the variety of GC responses to exercise reported in the literature.},

Chronic exercise training produces adrenal cortex hypertrophy and usually a smaller rise in plasma GC during an acute exercise bout than that obtained with nontrained subjects. The resting GC levels frequently increase initially during training but return to normal as the trained state is reached. 6. The changes in GC response during training appear to be produced by decreased responsiveness of the adrenal cortex itself to ACTH stimulation and possibly by adaptation of the hypothalamus-hypophysis axis which reduces the ACTH released in response to stress. 7. The many combinations of psychological and physiological stress present in different exercise regimens probably account for the variety of GC responses to exercise reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine whether school-level variability in implementation of immunization requirements is associated with the likelihood of a child having received an exemption to school immunization requirements.
METHODS: We surveyed 1000 school immunization personnel in Colorado, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Washington. We explored associations between school implementation of immunization requirements and the likelihood of a child having an exemption using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: School policies associated with an increased likelihood of children having exemptions included lack of provision of written instructions for completing the school immunization requirement before enrollment, administrative procedures making it easier to claim an exemption, and granting of philosophical exemptions. In the 2 states we surveyed where philosophical exemptions are not authorized (Massachusetts and Missouri), 17.0\% and 18.1\% of schools reported permitting philosophical exemptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistencies in the interpretation and implementation of school immunization laws contribute to variability in rates of exemptions. School policies should be reviewed to ensure consistency with the intent of state laws.},

	abstract = {How do attitudes toward vaccination change over the course of a public health crisis? We report results from a longitudinal survey of United States residents during six months (March 16 –August 16, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to past research suggesting that the increased salience of a disease threat should improve attitudes toward vaccines, we observed a decrease in intentions of getting a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening. We provide suggestive evidence that differential exposure to media channels and social networks could explain the observed asymmetric polarization between self-identified Democrats and Republicans.},

	abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the effects of three potentially anti-inflammatory probiotic bacteria from three different genera on immune variables in healthy adults in a clinical setting based on previous in vitro characterization of cytokine responses.
METHODS: A total of 62 volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention study. The volunteers were randomized to receive a milk-based drink containing either Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 (Bb12), or Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS (PJS) or a placebo drink for 3 wk. Venous blood and saliva samples were taken at baseline and on d 1, 7 and 21. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of intervention.
RESULTS: The serum hsCRP expressed as the median AUC(0-21) (minus baseline) was 0.018 mg/L in the placebo group, -0.240 mg/L in the LGG group, 0.090 mg/L in the Bb12 group and -0.085 mg/L in the PJS group (P = 0.014). In vitro production of TNF-alpha from in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was significantly lower in subjects receiving LGG vs placebo. IL-2 production from PBMC in the Bb12 group was significantly lower compared with the other groups.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, probiotic bacteria have strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.},

METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched in May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in paediatric or adult populations related to the study aim.
RESULTS: We included five RCTs with a total of 377 subjects (194 in the experimental group and 183 in the control group). The participants were adults (three RCTs, n = 266) and children (two RCTs, n = 111) with constipation. In adults, data suggests a favourable effect of treatment with Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, and Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 on defecation frequency and stool consistency. In children, L. casei rhamnosus Lcr35, but not L. rhamnosus GG, showed a beneficial effect.
CONCLUSION: Until more data are available, we believe the use of probiotics for the treatment of constipation condition should be considered investigational.},

	abstract = {In recent years, it has become apparent that low-grade vascular inflammation plays a key role in all stages of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Weight loss has been shown to improve blood inflammatory markers; however, it is unknown if weight-loss diets varying in macronutrient composition differentially affect inflammatory responses. The primary purpose of the present study was to compare a very-low-carbohydrate diet and a low-fat weight-loss diet on inflammatory biomarkers in overweight men. In a randomized cross-over design, 15 overweight men (body fat, {\textgreater}25\%; body mass index, 34 kg/m2) consumed two experimental weight-loss diets for two consecutive 6-week periods: a very-low-carbohydrate diet ({\textless}10\% energy via carbohydrate) and a low-fat diet ({\textless}30\% energy via fat). Both the low-fat and the very-low-carbohydrate diets resulted in significant decreases in absolute concentrations of hsTNF-α (high-sensitivity tumour necrosis factor-α), hsIL-6 (high-sensitivity interleukin-6), hsCRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and sICAM-1 (soluble intercellular cell-adhesion molecule-1). There was no significant change in absolute sP-selectin (soluble P-selectin) concentrations after either diet. Normalized inflammatory values represented as the delta change per 1 kg reduction in body mass showed a significant difference between the two diets only for sP-selectin (P{\textless}0.05). In summary, energy-restricted low-fat and very-low-carbohydrate diets both significantly decreased several biomarkers of inflammation. These data suggest that, in the short-term, weight loss is primarily the driving force underlying the reductions in most of the inflammatory biomarkers.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.numecd.2005.08.006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: It has been suggested that overall dietary patterns and not single nutrients should be studied, since food items might have a synergistic and antagonistic effect on health. The Mediterranean diet has long been associated with lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Therefore, we developed a diet score that incorporates the inherent characteristics of this dietary pattern.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 11 main components of the Mediterranean diet (non-refined cereals, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, olive oil, fish, red meat, poultry, full fat dairy products and alcohol). For the consumption of items presumed to be close to this pattern we assigned scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 when a participant reported no consumption, rare, frequent, very frequent, weekly and daily, respectively. For the consumption of foods presumed to be away from this pattern we assigned the scores on a reverse scale. Especially for alcohol, we assigned score 5 for consumption of less than 300 ml/day, score 0 for consumption of more than 700 ml/day or none and scores 1-4 for consumption of 300-400, 400-500, 500-600, and 600-700 ml/day (100 ml = 12 g ethanol), respectively. Then a total score ranging from 0 to 55 was calculated. After having applied this diet score in the participants of the ATTICA study we observed a significant positive association with monounsaturated fat and monounsaturated-to-saturated fat intake. We also observed, an inverse association with serum lipids, blood pressures, inflammation and coagulation markers related to cardiovascular disease. The application of that score in a case-control study (CARDIO2000) suggested that the score was inversely associated with the odds of having acute coronary syndromes.
CONCLUSION: The Mediterranean diet score proposed above may be useful in assessing the nutritional status of an individual and investigating the relationship of the Mediterranean diet with various health outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Our prior work has shown that the health behaviors of head and neck cancer patients are interrelated and are associated with quality of life; however, other than smoking, the relationship between health behaviors and survival is unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to determine the relationship between five pretreatment health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity, and sleep) and all-cause survival among 504 head and neck cancer patients.
RESULTS: Smoking status was the strongest predictor of survival, with both current smokers (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 4.4) and former smokers (HR = 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.5) showing significant associations with poor survival. Problem drinking was associated with survival in the univariate analysis (HR = 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.0 to 2.0) but lost significance when controlling for other factors. Low fruit intake was negatively associated with survival in the univariate analysis only (HR = 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 2.1), whereas vegetable intake was not significant in either univariate or multivariate analyses. Although physical activity was associated with survival in the univariate analysis (HR = 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 0.97), it was not significant in the multivariate model. Sleep was not significantly associated with survival in either univariate or multivariate analysis. Control variables that were also independently associated with survival in the multivariate analysis were age, education, tumor site, cancer stage, and surgical treatment.
CONCLUSION: Variation in selected pretreatment health behaviors (eg, smoking, fruit intake, and physical activity) in this population is associated with variation in survival.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              We sought to determine the prevalence of biologically relevant human papillomavirus (HPV) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retinoblastoma (Rb) downregulation by HPV E7 results in p16 upregulation. We hypothesized that p16 overexpression in OSCC defines HPV-induced tumors with favorable prognosis.
            
            
              Methods
              Using real-time polymerase chain reaction for HPV16, we determined HPV16 viral load in a cohort of 79 OSCCs annotated with long-term patient follow-up. A tissue microarray including these cases was also analyzed for p53, p16, and Rb utilizing in situ quantitative protein expression analysis. Seventy-seven tumors were classified into a three-class model on the basis of p16 expression and HPV-DNA presence: class I, HPV–, p16 low; class II, HPV+, p16 low; and class III, HPV+, p16 high.
            
            
              Results
              Sixty-one percent of OSCCs were HPV16+; HPV status alone was of no prognostic value for local recurrence and was barely significant for survival times. Overall survival was improved in class III (79\%) compared with the other two classes (20\% and 18\%; P = .0095). Disease-free survival for the same class was 75\% versus 15\% and 13\% (P = .0025). The 5-year local recurrence was 14\% in class III versus 45\% and 74\% (P = .03). Only patients in class III had significantly lower p53 and Rb expression (P = .017 and .001, respectively). Multivariable survival analysis confirmed the prognostic value of the three-class model.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Using this system for classification, we define the molecular profile of HPV+ OSCC with favorable prognosis, namely HPV+/p16 high (class III). This study defines a novel classification scheme that may have value for patient stratification for clinical trials testing HPV-targeted therapies.},

Interviews were obtained from 871 oral cancer patients and 979 controls among whites, frequency matched for age and sex. Consumption frequency of 61 food items was assessed in the questionnaire; attention was given to foods that are sources of vitamins A and C and carotene. The major finding was an inverse relationship between fruit intake and risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer; individuals in the highest quartile of intake had about half the risk of those in the lowest quartile. Vitamin C, carotene, or fiber in fruit did not appear to account completely for this relationship, since these nutrients in vegetables did not provide similar protection. This finding suggests the influence of other constituents in fruits, although it is possible that cooking vegetables may have a nutrient-diminishing effect. Dietary intake of other nutrients, such as the B vitamins, vitamin E, folate, and iron, showed no consistent relationship to risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer. Coffee or other hot beverage consumption did not increase risk; intake of nitrite-containing meats or cooking practices, such as smoking, pickling, or charcoal grilling, also did not increase risk. All analyses were adjusted for the effects of tobacco and alcohol, strong risk factors for oral and pharyngeal cancer. Dietary findings among the few subjects who did not use tobacco or alcohol were similar to those for all subjects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A few papers have considered reproducibility of a posteriori dietary patterns across populations, as well as pattern associations with head and neck cancer risk when multiple populations are available.
METHODS: We used individual-level pooled data from seven case-control studies (3844 cases; 6824 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology consortium. We simultaneously derived shared and study-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-study factor analysis applied to 23 nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined, and larynx, from logistic regression models.
RESULTS: We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible across studies (75\% variance explained): the Antioxidant vitamins and fiber (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI = 0.41, 0.78, highest versus lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI = 0.67, 0.95) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk. The Animal products and cereals (OR = 1.5, 95\% CI = 1.1, 2.1) and the Fats (OR = 1.8, 95\% CI = 1.4, 2.3) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk, whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for the Antioxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additional study-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined. We named them all as Dairy products and breakfast cereals, and two were associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Multi-study factor analysis provides insight into pattern reproducibility and supports previous evidence on cross-country reproducibility of dietary patterns and on their association with head and neck cancer risk. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B430.},

Some of the mechanisms by which blueberries have been shown to prevent carcinogenesis include inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, oxidative stress and products of oxidative stress such as DNA damage, inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. This review will focus on the preclinical and clinical evidence that supports blueberries as an anti-cancer fruit, as well as expressing the need for more preclinical studies and the conduction of clinical studies with respect to the cancer preventive ability of blueberries.},

Noninfectious diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and diabetes are major causes of death, whereas dementia cases are also increasing to 'epidemic' proportion. This review will focus on recent progress on mechanisms underlying the potential role of dietary phytochemicals in CVD, diabetes, cancer and dementia, with consideration of the latest clinical data.
RECENT FINDINGS: The association of tea (Camellia sinensis), particularly catechins, with reported mechanistic effects for CVD, diabetes, cancer and cognition contributes to our understanding of the suggested benefits of tea consumption on health from limited and inconclusive clinical trial and epidemiological data. Resveratrol, which occurs in grapes (Vitis vinifera) and wine, and curcumin, a component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), are also emerging as potentially relevant to health, particularly for CVD and dementia, with some promising data also concluded for curcumin in cancer. Other phytochemicals mechanistically relevant for health include anthocyanins, isoflavones and glucosinolates, which are also discussed.
SUMMARY: Evidence for the role of phytochemicals in health and disease is growing, but associations between phytochemicals and disease need to be more firmly understood and established from more robust clinical data using preparations that have been phytochemically characterized.},

Studies carried out during the past 2-3 decades have shown that these phytochemicals have an important role in preventing chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, coronary heart disease and hyper-cholesterolaemia. The major classes of phytochemicals with disease-preventing functions are dietary fibre, antioxidants, detoxifying agents, immunity-potentiating agents and neuropharmacological agents. Each class of these functional agents consists of a wide range of chemicals with differing potency. For example, antioxidant function is exhibited by some nutrients, such as vitamin E, vitamin C and provitamin A. Other phytochemicals that have antioxidant properties are carotenoids, phenolic compounds, flavonoids and isothiocyanates. Some of these phytochemicals have more than one function. Foods rich in these chemicals and exhibiting disease-protecting potential are called functional foods. Indian habitual diets, which are based predominantly on plant foods like cereals, pulses, oils and spices, are all good sources of these classes of phytochemicals, particularly dietary fibre, vitamin E, carotenoids and phenolic compounds. There is, however, much scope for further systematic research in screening Indian foods and diets for these phytochemicals and assessing their potential in protecting against chronic diseases.},

In our study, the protective effects of BA against stress induced by PFOA was investigated in the planarian Dugesia japonica using oxidative stress biomarkers, ATP contents, ATPase activity, DNA methylation and mRNA expression. PFOA exposure could resulted in malondialdehyde production. At the same time, treatment with BA decreased the production of malondialdehyde in BA-exposed and co-treatment planarians. PFOA caused activities increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and activities decrease in glutathione reductase (GR). PFOA exposure decreased the GSH and ATP contents. Additionally, it increased the GSSG contents and ATPase activity. BA administration increased the activities of GPx, GST and GR in BA and co-treatment planarians. Meanwhile BA maintained the contents of ATP, ATPase activity, GSH and GSSG by alleviating PFOA toxicity. Moreover, PFOA and BA increased the contents of 5-methylcytosine and decreased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in all group. In addition, PFOA and BA treated planarians significantly altered the expression of genes associated with above biochemical parameters. The results showed that the mRNA expression of gpx, Djgst, gr, Djnak and dnmt1 were significantly elevated in all groups. Alterations in the mRNA expression levels indicated a stress response to PFOA exposure and anthocyanin protection. These alterations regulated biomarkers of oxidative stress, energy metabolism and DNA methylation levels in planarians. These results indicate that BA attenuated PFOA-induced oxidative stress, energy metabolism, DNA methylation and gene expression disorders.},

Fourteen unique anthocyanins were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The anticancer bioactivity of the extracts on KB cells was analyzed using methylthiazolyl-tetrazolium (MTT), flow cytometry (FCM) and immunocytochemistry. It was shown that the blueberry anthocyanins suppressed the proliferation of KB cells in a dose-dependent manner, as well as induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of oral cancer KB cells. Immunocytochemistry analysis showed that the expression of caspase-9 and cytochrome c were obviously increased after the anthocyanins treatment. Western blot analysis also indicated that the expression of p53 was increased. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) showed that the amount of unmethylated p53 increased, indicating that the anthocyanins can down-regulate the methylation of p53.},

The anthocyanins (ACs) in black raspberries are responsible, at least in part, for their cancer-inhibitory effects. In the present study, we asked if ACs are responsible for the demethylation effects observed in colorectal cancers. Three days of treatment of ACs at 0.5, 5, and 25 μg/ml suppressed activity and protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in HCT116, Caco2 and SW480 cells. Promoters of CDKN2A, and SFRP2, SFRP5, and WIF1, upstream of Wnt pathway, were demethylated by ACs. mRNA expression of some of these genes was increased. mRNA expression of β-catenin and c-Myc, downstream of Wnt pathway, and cell proliferation were decreased; apoptosis was increased. ACs were taken up into HCT116 cells and were differentially localized with DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the same cells visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Although it was reported that DNMT3B is regulated by c-Myc in mouse lymphoma, DNMT3B did not bind with c-Myc in HCT116 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that ACs are responsible, at least in part, for the demethylation effects of whole black raspberries in colorectal cancers.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Emerging evidence suggests muscle depletion predicts survival of patients with cancer.
            
            
              Patients and Methods
              At a cancer center in Alberta, Canada, consecutive patients with cancer (lung or GI; N = 1,473) were assessed at presentation for weight loss history, lumbar skeletal muscle index, and mean muscle attenuation (Hounsfield units) by computed tomography (CT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Concordance (c) statistics were used to test predictive accuracy of survival models.
            
            
              Results
              Body mass index (BMI) distribution was 17\% obese, 35\% overweight, 36\% normal weight, and 12\% underweight. Patients in all BMI categories varied widely in weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation. Thresholds defining associations between these three variables and survival were determined using optimal stratification. High weight loss, low muscle index, and low muscle attenuation were independently prognostic of survival. A survival model containing conventional covariates (cancer diagnosis, stage, age, performance status) gave a c statistic of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.79), whereas a model ignoring conventional variables and including only BMI, weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation gave a c statistic of 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.88 to 0.95; P {\textless} .001). Patients who possessed all three of these poor prognostic variables survived 8.4 months (95\% CI, 6.5 to 10.3), regardless of whether they presented as obese, overweight, normal weight, or underweight, in contrast to patients who had none of these features, who survived 28.4 months (95\% CI, 24.2 to 32.6; P {\textless} .001).
            
            
              Conclusion
              CT images reveal otherwise occult muscle depletion. Patients with cancer who are cachexic by the conventional criterion (involuntary weight loss) and by two additional criteria (muscle depletion and low muscle attenuation) share a poor prognosis, regardless of overall body weight.},

	abstract = {Time-varying covariance occurs when a covariate changes over time during the follow-up period. Such variable can be analyzed with the Cox regression model to estimate its effect on survival time. For this it is essential to organize the data in a counting process style. In situations when the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox regression model does not hold, we say that the effect of the covariate is time-varying. The proportional hazards assumption can be tested by examining the residuals of the model. The rejection of the null hypothesis induces the use of time varying coefficient to describe the data. The time varying coefficient can be described with a step function or a parametric time function. This article aims to illustrate how to carry out statistical analyses in the presence of time-varying covariates or coefficients with R.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Approximately 30\% higher grade premalignant oral intraepithelial neoplasia (OIN) lesions will progress to oral cancer. Although surgery is the OIN treatment mainstay, many OIN lesions recur, which is highly problematic for both surgeons and patients. This clinical trial assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of a natural product-based bioadhesive gel on OIN lesions.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This placebo-controlled multicenter study investigated the effects of topical application of bioadhesive gels that contained either 10\% w/w freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) or an identical formulation devoid of BRB placebo to biopsy-confirmed OIN lesions (0.5 g × q.i.d., 12 weeks). Baseline evaluative parameters (size, histologic grade, LOH events) were comparable in the randomly assigned BRB (n = 22) and placebo (n = 18) gel cohorts. Evaluative parameters were: histologic grade, clinical size, and LOH.
RESULTS: Topical application of the BRB gel to OIN lesions resulted in statistically significant reductions in lesional sizes, histologic grades, and LOH events. In contrast, placebo gel lesions demonstrated a significant increase in lesional size and no significant effects on histologic grade or LOH events. Collectively, these data strongly support BRB's chemopreventive impact. A cohort of very BRB-responsive patients, as demonstrated by high therapeutic efficacy, was identified. Corresponding protein profiling studies, which demonstrated higher pretreatment levels of BRB metabolic and keratinocyte differentiation enzymes in BRB-responsive lesions, reinforce the importance of local metabolism and differentiation competency.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this trial substantiate the LOH reductions identified in the pilot BRB gel study and extend therapeutic effects to significant improvements in histologic grade and lesional size.},

	abstract = {Importance: Case-control studies show a possible relationship between oral bacteria and head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Prospective studies are needed to examine the temporal relationship between oral microbiome and subsequent risk of HNSCC.
Objective: To prospectively examine associations between the oral microbiome and incident HNSCC.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study was carried out in 2 prospective cohort studies: the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Among 122 004 participants, 129 incident patient cases of HNSCC were identified during an average 3.9 years of follow-up. Two controls per patient case (n = 254) were selected through incidence density sampling, matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. All participants provided mouthwash samples and were cancer-free at baseline.
Exposures: Oral microbiome composition and specific bacterial abundances were determined through bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall oral microbiome composition and specific taxa abundances were compared for the case group and the control group, using PERMANOVA and negative binomial generalized linear models, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, cohort, smoking, alcohol, and oral human papillomavirus-16 status. Taxa with a 2-sided false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-value (q-value) {\textless}.10 were considered significant.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident HNSCC.
Results: The study included 58 patient cases from CPS-II (mean [SD] age, 71.0 [6.4] years; 16 [27.6\%] women) and 71 patient cases from PLCO (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [4.8] years; 13 [18.3\%] women). Two controls per patient case (n = 254) were selected through incidence density sampling, matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. Head and neck squamous cell cancer cases and controls were similar with respect to age, sex, and race. Patients in the case group were more often current tobacco smokers, tended to have greater alcohol consumption (among drinkers), and to be positive for oral carriage of papillomavirus-16. Overall microbiome composition was not associated with risk of HNSCC. Greater abundance of genera Corynebacterium (fold change [FC], 0.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.80; q = .06) and Kingella (FC, 0.63; 95\% CI, 0.46-0.86; q = .08) were associated with decreased risk of HNSCC, potentially owing to carcinogen metabolism capacity. These findings were consistent for both cohorts and by cohort follow-up time. The observed relationships tended to be stronger for larynx cancer and for individuals with a history of tobacco use.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study demonstrates that greater oral abundance of commensal Corynebacterium and Kingella is associated with decreased risk of HNSCC, with potential implications for cancer prevention.},

Working with humans, we sought to understand the source of variable responses to GT by examining its effects on oral epithelium. Lingual epithelial RNA and lingual and gingival microbiota were measured before and after 4 weeks of exposure in tobacco smokers, whom are at high risk of oral cancer. GT consumption had on average inconsistent effects on miRNA expression in the oral epithelium. Only analysis that examined paired miRNAs, showing changed and coordinated expression with GT exposure, provided evidence for a GT effect on miRNAs, identifying miRNAs co-expressed with two hubs, miR-181a-5p and 301a-3p. An examination of the microbiome on cancer prone lingual mucosa, in contrast, showed clear shifts in the relative abundance of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, and other genera after GT exposure. These data support the idea that tea consumption can consistently change oral bacteria in humans, which may affect carcinogenesis, but argue that GT effects on oral epithelial miRNA expression in humans vary between individuals.},

All anthocyanins were partially degraded in saliva. Degradation of chokeberry anthocyanins in saliva was temperature dependent and decreased by heating saliva to 80 °C and after removal of cells. Glycosides of delphinidin and petunidin were more susceptible to degradation than those of cyanidin, pelargonidin, peonidin and malvidin in both intact and artificial saliva. Stability of di- and tri-saccharide conjugates of anthocyanidins slightly, but significantly, exceeded that of monosaccharide compounds. Ex vivo degradation of anthocyanins in saliva was significantly decreased after oral rinsing with antibacterial chlorhexidine.

The bacteria are responsible for the two commonest bacterial diseases of man: dental caries (tooth decay) and the periodontal (gum) diseases. Archaea are restricted to a small number of species of methanogens while around 1000 bacterial species have been found, with representatives from the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes and Tenericutes and the uncultured divisions GN02, SR1 and TM7. Around half of oral bacteria are as yet uncultured and culture-independent methods have been successfully used to comprehensively describe the oral bacterial community. The human oral microbiome database (HOMD, www.homd.org) provides a comprehensive resource consisting of descriptions of oral bacterial taxa, a 16S rRNA identification tool and a repository of oral bacterial genome sequences. Individuals' oral microbiomes are highly specific at the species level, although overall the human oral microbiome shows few geographical differences. Although caries and periodontitis are clearly bacterial diseases, they are not infectious diseases in the classical sense because they result from a complex interaction between the commensal microbiota, host susceptibility and environmental factors such as diet and smoking. Periodontitis, in particular, appears to result from an inappropriate inflammatory reaction to the normal microbiota, exacerbated by the presence of some disease-associated bacterial species. In functional terms, there appears to considerable redundancy among the oral microbiota and a focus on functional rather than phylogenetic diversity may be required in order to fully understand host-microbiome interactions.},

	volume = {20},
	issn = {0011-8532},
	abstract = {Consideration of nutritional factors as determinants of oral microbial ecology leads to the conclusion that endogenous factors play a dominant role. It is the interactions between specific microorganisms and nutritional and other factors provided by the host that selectively determine the kinds of microorganisms which willinitially reside in the oral cavity and the sites which they will colonize. The persistence of these original "colonists" in their respective ecologic niches will depend in part on the accessibility of endogenous nutrients variously provided by saliva, tissue exudates, crevicular fluids, or degenerating host cells. It will also depend on their response to and interaction with microorganisms which immigrate to that site subsequently. The microbial ecology of a given site is therefore rarely uncomplicated, the notable exception occurring at the most microscopic level where one may encounter microcolonies of individual species within more heterogenous populations of microorganisms. The extent of this heterogeneity quantitatively and qualitatively is a reflection of the degree to which the interactions between the resident flora and the new arrivals, plus the local environmental changes which they both generate, serve to promote or to discourage the survival and growth of the individual species. This element of heterogeneity in a dynamic system with its inherent potential for variation makes it possible for relatively minor changes in local environmental conditions to result in significant differences in the microflora between one site and another even though they may be in close proximity to each other. Once this concept is appreciated it becomes easy to understand how disease processes such as dental caries may affect specific areas of a tooth while nearby areas are unaffected. The effects of exogenous nutrients on the ecology of the oral microbiota, nevertheless cannot be ignored. The diet may modulate such endogenous factors as the salivary secretions and the local resistance of the gingival tissues to infections. Although at our present state of knowledge the direct influence of dietary proteins and fats on the oral microbiota is thought to be of relatively minor consequence, dietary carbohydrates are of major ecological significance. Dietary sugars provide readily available substrates for the oral microorganisms, most of which depend on carbohydrates for energy sources. The metabolism of dietary sucrose by S. sanguis and S. mutans with the productions of acids and intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides has specific influence on the microbial composition, metabolic activities, and mass of coronal plaque. The ready availability of dietary carbohydrates undoubtedly influences the microflora of other parts of the oral cavity as well, eic species or indirectly through the interactions of other organisms with them...},

	abstract = {Recent analyses with ribosomal RNA-based technologies have revealed the diversity of bacterial populations within dental biofilms, and have highlighted their important contributions to oral health and disease. Dental biofilms are exceedingly complex and multispecies ecosystems, where oral bacteria interact cooperatively or competitively with other members. Bacterial interactions that influence dental biofilm communities include various different mechanisms. During the early stage of biofilm formation, it is known that planktonic bacterial cells directly attach to surfaces of the oral cavity or indirectly bind to other bacterial cells that have already colonized. Adherence through co-aggregation may be critical for the temporary retention of bacteria on dental surfaces, and may facilitate eventual bacterial colonization. It is likely that metabolic communication, genetic exchange, production of inhibitory factors (e.g., bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide, etc.), and quorum-sensing are pivotal regulatory factors that determine the bacterial composition and/or metabolism. Since each bacterium can easily access a neighboring bacterial cell and its metabolites, genetic exchanges and metabolic communication may occur frequently in dental biofilms. Quorum-sensing is defined as gene regulation in response to cell density, which influences various functions, e.g., virulence and bacteriocin production. In this review, we discuss these important interactions among oral bacteria within the dental biofilm communities.},

The form was administered by mail twice to a sample of 127 participants at a one-year interval. During this interval, men completed two one-week diet records spaced approximately 6 months apart. Mean values for intake of most nutrients assessed by the two methods were similar. Intraclass correlation coefficients for nutrient intakes assessed by questionnaires one year apart ranged from 0.47 for vitamin E without supplements to 0.80 for vitamin C with supplements. Correlation coefficients between the energy-adjusted nutrient intakes measured by diet records and the second questionnaire (which asked about diet during the year encompassing the diet records) ranged from 0.28 for iron without supplements to 0.86 for vitamin C with supplements (mean r = 0.59). These correlations were higher after adjusting for week-to-week variation in diet record intakes (mean r = 0.65). These data indicate that the expanded semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire is reproducible and provides a useful measure of intake for many nutrients over a one-year period.},

In this article, we summarise recent advances in microbiome studies across both Western and non-Western populations, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal surveys, and over various age groups, revealing a considerable diversity and variability in the human gut microbiome. Of all the exogenous factors affecting gut microbiome, a long-term diet appears to have the largest effect to date. Recent research on the effects of dietary interventions has shown that the gut microbiome can change dramatically with diet; however, the gut microbiome is generally resilient, and short-term dietary intervention is not typically successful in treating obesity and malnutrition. Understanding the dynamics of the gut microbiome under different conditions will help us diagnose and treat many diseases that are now known to be associated with microbial communities.},

	doi = {10.1038/s41424-018-0067-7},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence that the microbiome contributes to esophageal disease. Diet, especially fiber and fat intake, is a known potent modifier of the colonic microbiome, but its impact on the esophageal microbiome is not well described. We hypothesized that dietary fiber and fat intake would be associated with a distinct esophageal microbiome.
METHODS: We collected esophageal samples from 47 ambulatory patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire quantifying dietary fiber and fat intake. Using 16S high-throughput sequencing, we determined composition of the esophageal microbiome and predicted functional capacity of microbiota based on fiber and fat intake.
RESULTS: Among all samples, the most abundant phyla were Firmicutes (54.0\%), Proteobacteria (19.0\%), Bacteroidetes (17.0\%), Actinobacteria (5.2\%), and Fusobacteria (4.3\%). Increasing fiber intake was significantly associated with increasing relative abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.04) and decreasing relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria overall (p = 0.03). Low fiber intake was associated with increased relative abundance of several Gram-negative bacteria, including Prevotella, Neisseria, and Eikenella. Several predicted metabolic pathways differed between highest and lowest quartile of fiber intake. Fat intake was associated with altered relative abundance of few taxa, with no alterations at the phylum level and no changes in microbiome functional composition.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary fiber, but not fat, intake was associated with a distinct esophageal microbiome. Diet should be considered an important modifier of the esophageal microbiome in future studies. Studies are also needed to elucidate how the effects of dietary fiber on the esophageal microbiome may contribute to esophageal disease.},

This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding").

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448143/},
	abstract = {A case-control study is a type of observational study commonly used to look at factors associated with diseases or outcomes.[1]  The case-control study starts with a group of cases, which are the individuals who have the outcome of interest. The researcher then tries to construct a second group of individuals called the controls, who are similar to the case individuals but do not have the outcome of interest. The researcher then looks at historical factors to identify if some exposure(s) is/are found more commonly in the cases than the controls. If the exposure is found more commonly in the cases than the controls, the researcher can hypothesize that the exposure may be linked to the outcome of interest.  For example, a researcher may want to look at the rare cancer Kaposi's sarcoma. The researcher would find a group of individuals with Kaposi's sarcoma (the cases) and compare them to a group of patients who are similar to the cases in most ways but do not have Kaposi's sarcoma (controls). The researcher could then ask about various exposures to see if any exposure is more common in those with Kaposi's sarcoma (the cases) than those without Kaposi's sarcoma (the controls). The researcher might find that those with Kaposi's sarcoma are more likely to have HIV, and thus conclude that HIV may be a risk factor for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma. Advantages There are many advantages to case-control studies.  First, the case-control approach allows for the study of rare diseases.   If a disease occurs very infrequently, one would have to follow a large group of people for a long period of time to accrue enough incident cases to study. Such use of resources may be impractical, so a case-control study can be useful for identifying current cases and evaluating historical associated factors.  For example, if a disease developed in 1 in 1000 people per year (0.001/year) then in ten years one would expect about 10 cases of a disease to exist in a group of 1000 people. If the disease is much rarer, say 1 in 1,000,0000 per year (0.0000001/year) this would require either having to follow 1,000,0000 people for ten years or 1000 people for 1000 years to accrue ten total cases. As it may be impractical to follow 1,000,000 for ten years or to wait 1000 years for recruitment, a case-control study allows for a more feasible approach.  Second, the case-control study design makes it possible to look at multiple risk factors at a once. In the example above about Kaposi's sarcoma, the researcher could ask both the cases and controls about exposures to HIV, asbestos, smoking, lead, sunburns, aniline dye, alcohol, herpes, human papillomavirus, or any number of possible exposures to identify those most likely associated with Kaposi's sarcoma. Case-control studies can also be very helpful when disease outbreaks occur, and potential links and exposures need to be identified.  This study mechanism can be commonly seen in food-related disease outbreaks associated with contaminated products, or when rare diseases start to increase in frequency, as has been seen with measles in recent years. Because of these advantages, case-control studies are commonly used as one of the first studies to build evidence of an association between exposure and an event or disease. In a case-control study, the investigator can include unequal numbers of cases with controls such as 2:1 or 4:1 to increase the power of the study. Disadvantages and Limitations The most commonly cited disadvantage in case-control studies is the potential for recall bias.[2]  Recall bias in a case-control study is the increased likelihood that those with the outcome will recall and report exposures compared to those without the outcome.  In other words, even if both groups had exactly the same exposures, the participants in the cases group may report the exposure more often than the controls do.  Recall bias may lead to concluding that there are associations between the exposure and disease that do not, in fact, exist. It is due to subjects' imperfect memories of past exposures.  If people with Kaposi's sarcoma are asked about exposure and history (e.g., HIV, asbestos, smoking, lead, sunburn, aniline dye, alcohol, herpes, human papillomavirus), the individuals with the disease are more likely to think harder about these exposures and recall having some of the exposures that the healthy controls. Case-control studies, due to their typically retrospective nature, can be used to establish a correlation between exposures and outcomes, but cannot establish causation. These studies simply attempt to find correlations between past events and the current state.  When designing a case-control study, the researcher must find an appropriate control group. Ideally, the case group (those with the outcome) and the control group (those without the outcome) will have almost the same characteristics, such as age, gender, overall health status, and other factors. The two groups should have similar histories and live in similar environments. If, for example, our cases of Kaposi's sarcoma came from across the country but our controls were only chosen from a small community in northern latitudes where people rarely go outside or get sunburns, asking about sunburn may not be a valid exposure to investigate.  Similarly, if all of the cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were found to come from a small community outside a battery factory with high levels of lead in the environment, then controls from across the country with minimal lead exposure would not provide an appropriate control group.  The investigator must put a great deal of effort into creating a proper control group to bolster the strength of the case-control study as well as enhance their ability to find true and valid potential correlations between exposures and disease states. Similarly, the researcher must recognize the potential for failing to identify confounding variables or exposures, introducing the possibility of confounding bias, which occurs when a variable that is not being accounted for that has a relationship with both the exposure and outcome.  This can cause us to accidentally be studying something we are not accounting for but that may be systematically different between the groups.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors have substantial psychological distress in addition to treatment-related side effects. This study examines the long-term quality of life (QOL) of HNC survivors in a busy tertiary care center.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional survey was conducted studying 212 HNC survivors 1 year after completion of their treatment at a tertiary cancer center. Quality of life assessments were performed using the 2 standardized health-related QOL questionnaires: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 and The Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Cancer Module.
RESULTS: The overall global QOL rating for the study cohort was satisfactory. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 scores showed that the domains where most patients faired poorly included financial difficulties (54\%), appetite loss (36\%), fatigue (33\%), and cough (30\%). The Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Cancer Module scale identified the domains with poor scores to be dry mouth (64\%), dental problems (42\%), sticky saliva (40\%), cough (39\%), and problems with mouth opening (32\%). Patients with early-stage tumors and those treated with surgery alone had significantly better QOL scores when compared with advanced stage tumors and patients receiving either radiation alone or multimodality treatment, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life questionnaires provide a medium for patients to effectively communicate with their physician in a busy tertiary care facility and provide an insight into the physical, psychological, and social problems affecting our patients which can then direct future interventions.},

In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

	abstract = {Background: Prebiotic soluble fibers are fermented by beneficial bacteria in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are proposed to have systemic anti-inflammatory effects.
Objective: This review examines the effect of SCFAs, prebiotics, and pre- and probiotic combinations (synbiotics) on systemic inflammation.
Design: Relevant English language studies from 1947 to May 2017 were identified with the use of online databases. Studies were considered eligible if they examined the effects of SCFAs, prebiotics, or synbiotics; were delivered orally, intravenously, or per rectum; were on biomarkers of systemic inflammation in humans; and performed meta-analysis where possible.
Results: Sixty-eight studies were included. Fourteen of 29 prebiotic studies and 13 of 26 synbiotic studies reported a significant decrease in ≥1 marker of systemic inflammation. Eight studies compared prebiotic and synbiotic supplementation, 2 of which reported a decrease in inflammation with synbiotics only, with 1 reporting a greater anti-inflammatory effect with synbiotics than with prebiotics alone. Meta-analyses indicated that prebiotics reduce C-reactive protein (CRP) [standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.60; 95\% CI: -0.98, -0.23], and synbiotics reduce CRP (SMD: -0.40; 95\% CI: -0.73, -0.06) and tumor necrosis factor-α (SMD -0.90; 95\% CI: -1.50, -0.30).
Conclusions: There is significant heterogeneity of outcomes in studies examining the effect of prebiotics and synbiotics on systemic inflammation. Approximately 50\% of included studies reported a decrease in ≥1 inflammatory biomarker. The inconsistency in reported outcomes may be due to heterogeneity in study design, supplement formulation, dosage, duration, and subject population. Nonetheless, meta-analyses provide evidence to support the systemic anti-inflammatory effects of prebiotic and synbiotic supplementation.},

	abstract = {The connection between the gut microbiota and the aetiology of obesity and cardiometabolic disorders is increasingly being recognized by clinicians. Our gut microbiota might affect the cardiometabolic phenotype by fermenting indigestible dietary components and thereby producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These SCFA are not only of importance in gut health and as signalling molecules, but might also enter the systemic circulation and directly affect metabolism or the function of peripheral tissues. In this Review, we discuss the effects of three SCFA (acetate, propionate and butyrate) on energy homeostasis and metabolism, as well as how these SCFA can beneficially modulate adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver tissue function. As a result, these SCFA contribute to improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we also summarize the increasing evidence for a potential role of SCFA as metabolic targets to prevent and counteract obesity and its associated disorders in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. However, most data are derived from animal and in vitro studies, and consequently the importance of SCFA and differential SCFA availability in human energy and substrate metabolism remains to be fully established. Well-controlled human intervention studies investigating the role of SCFA on cardiometabolic health are, therefore, eagerly awaited.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied the association of digestible carbohydrates, fiber intake, glycemic index, and glycemic load with insulin sensitivity (S(I)), fasting insulin, acute insulin response (AIR), disposition index, BMI, and waist circumference.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on 979 adults with normal (67\%) and impaired (33\%) glucose tolerance from the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (1992-1994) were analyzed. Usual dietary intake was assessed via a 114-item interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire from which nutrient intakes were estimated. Published glycemic index values were assigned to food items and average dietary glycemic index and glycemic load calculated per subject. S(I) and AIR were determined by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Disposition index was calculated by multiplying S(I) with AIR. Multiple linear regression modeling was employed.
RESULTS: No association was observed between glycemic index and S(I), fasting insulin, AIR, disposition index, BMI, or waist circumference after adjustment for demographic characteristics or family history of diabetes, energy expenditure, and smoking. Associations observed for digestible carbohydrates and glycemic load, respectively, with S(I), insulin secretion, and adiposity (adjusted for demographics and main confounders) were entirely explained by energy intake. In contrast, fiber was associated positively with S(I) and disposition index and inversely with fasting insulin, BMI, and waist circumference but not with AIR.
CONCLUSION: Carbohydrates as reflected in glycemic index and glycemic load may not be related to measures of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and adiposity. Fiber intake may not only have beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and adiposity, but also on pancreatic functionality.},

Soluble fiber beneficially affects metabolism, and fiber supplementation may be a feasible approach to improve body composition and glycemia in adults with overweight and obesity.Objective: We evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of isolated soluble fiber supplementation in overweight and obese adults on outcomes related to weight management [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2), body weight, percentage of body fat, and waist circumference] and glucose and insulin metabolism (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and fasting insulin) through a systematic review and meta-analysis.Design: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Cochrane Library databases. Eligible studies were RCTs that compared isolated soluble fiber with placebo treatments without energy-restriction protocols. Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes and 95\% CIs. Meta-regressions were performed to assess outcomes in relation to the intervention duration, fiber dose, and fiber type. Publication bias was assessed via Begg's and Egger's tests and funnel plot inspection.Results: Findings from 12 RCTs (n = 609 participants) from 2 to 17 wk of duration are summarized in this review. Soluble fiber supplementation reduced BMI by 0.84 (95\% CI: -1.35, -0.32; P = 0.001), body weight by 2.52 kg (95\% CI: -4.25, -0.79 kg; P = 0.004), body fat by 0.41\% (95\% CI: -0.58\%, -0.24\%; P {\textless} 0.001), fasting glucose by 0.17 mmol/L (95\% CI: -0.28, -0.06 mmol/L; P = 0.002), and fasting insulin by 15.88 pmol/L (95\% CI: -29.05, -2.71 pmol/L; P = 0.02) compared with the effects of placebo treatments. No publication bias was identified. Considerable between-study heterogeneity was observed for most outcomes.Conclusions: Isolated soluble fiber supplementation improves anthropometric and metabolic outcomes in overweight and obese adults, thereby indicating that supplementation may improve fiber intake and health in these individuals. However, the interpretation of these findings warrants caution because of the considerable between-study heterogeneity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03003897.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between daily glycemic index, daily glycemic load, simple sugars, dietary fiber, and the prevalence of a measure of insulin resistance in 30- to 60-year-old nondiabetic Danish men and women.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Inter99 study is a nonpharmacological intervention study. We used baseline data and examined cross-sectional associations between carbohydrate-related dietary factors and an estimate of insulin resistance in 5,675 subjects at 30-60 years. The dietary intake was estimated from a self-administered food frequency questionnaire, and insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Multiple regressions were performed with HOMA-IR as the dependent variable and carbohydrate-related factors as explanatory variables. All models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, physical activity, total energy intake, BMI, and waist circumference.
RESULTS: Intake of lactose was positively associated with HOMA-IR (P {\textless} 0.0001), whereas daily glycemic load and intake of glucose, fructose, dietary fiber, total carbohydrate, fruit, and vegetables were inversely associated with HOMA-IR (P {\textless} 0.05). Intake of dietary fiber explained the associations with daily glycemic load and total carbohydrate and attenuated the association with fruit and vegetables. No significant associations were observed for daily glycemic index or sucrose.
CONCLUSIONS: Habitual intake of diets with a high glycemic index and high glycemic load or diets with a high content of total carbohydrate including simple sugars was not associated with the probability of having insulin resistance. Furthermore, intake of dietary fiber was inversely associated with the probability of having insulin resistance.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV head and neck squamous cell cancer were randomly assigned to concurrent radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without tirapazamine. In this substudy, analyses were restricted to patients with oropharyngeal cancer. p16 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and HPV was detected by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Slides were available for p16 assay in 206 of 465 patients, of which 185 were eligible, and p16 and HPV were evaluable in 172 patients. One hundred six (57\%) of 185 were p16-positive, and in patients evaluable for both p16 and HPV, 88 (86\%) of 102 p16-positive patients were also HPV-positive. Patients who were p16-positive had lower T and higher N categories and better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. p16-positive tumors compared with p16-negative tumors were associated with better 2-year overall survival (91\% v 74\%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.17 to 0.74; P = .004) and failure-free survival (87\% v 72\%; HR, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 0.74; P = .003). p16 was a significant prognostic factor on multivariable analysis (HR, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.21 to 0.96; P = .04). p16-positive patients had lower rates of locoregional failure and deaths due to other causes. There was a trend favoring the tirapazamine arm for improved locoregional control in p16-negative patients (HR, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.09 to 1.24; P = .13).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinomas caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with favorable survival, but the independent prognostic significance of tumor HPV status remains unknown.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy (with acceleration by means of concomitant boost radiotherapy) with standard-fractionation radiotherapy, each combined with cisplatin therapy, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients with HPV-positive cancer and those with HPV-negative cancer.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 3-year rate of overall survival was similar in the group receiving accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy and the group receiving standard-fractionation radiotherapy (70.3\% vs. 64.3\%; P=0.18; hazard ratio for death with accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13), as were the rates of high-grade acute and late toxic events. A total of 63.8\% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (206 of 323) had HPV-positive tumors; these patients had better 3-year rates of overall survival (82.4\%, vs. 57.1\% among patients with HPV-negative tumors; P{\textless}0.001 by the log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, race, tumor and nodal stage, tobacco exposure, and treatment assignment, had a 58\% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The risk of death significantly increased with each additional pack-year of tobacco smoking. Using recursive-partitioning analysis, we classified our patients as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of death on the basis of four factors: HPV status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00047008.)},

RESULTS: Of 264 patients with OPC, 111 (42\%) had evaluable biopsies; 56 (50\%) were HPV+ and 55 (50\%) were HPV-. HPV+ patients were significantly younger (54 versus 58 years, P = 0.02), had T1/T2 primary cancers (49\% versus 20\%, P = 0.001), and had a performance status of zero (77\% versus 49\%, P = 0.003).

Local-regional failure was less in HPV+ patients (13\% versus 42\%, P = 0.0006); at 5 years, 82\% of HPV+ patients were alive compared with 35\% of HPV- patients (P {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: HPV+ OPC has a different biology compared with HPV- OPC; 5-year OS, PFS, and local-regional control are unprecedented. These results support the possibility of selectively reducing therapy and long-term morbidity in HPV+ OPC while preserving survival and approaching HPV- disease with more aggressive treatment.},

	doi = {10.1053/jren.2002.29598},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) are frequently used in epidemiologic studies of nutrition and food intake. However, the use of FFQs in patients receiving maintenance dialysis has not been extensively studied. We hypothesize that FFQ is a useful tool to assess the food intake differences between patients receiving dialysis and patients not receiving dialysis.
DESIGN: Matched exposed-unexposed study with case-controlled design.
SETTING: Outpatient dialysis unit affiliated with a tertiary-care community medical center.
PATIENTS: From a pool of 102 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) outpatients in a community dialysis unit, 30 adult MHD outpatients (15 men, 15 women, aged 55.8 +/- 14.6 years) were selected randomly as case subjects. They included 16 African Americans, 8 whites, 4 Hispanics, and 2 Asians. Eleven MHD patients took the multivitamin, Nephrovite (R\&D Laboratories, Marina del Rey, CA), regularly. From an archive of 1,610 nondialytic individuals with known FFQ data, 30 control subjects were selected randomly to match the age, race, and sex of the case subjects.
INTERVENTION: We used Block's FFQ (version 98), an 8-page self-administered questionnaire that has been widely used in epidemiologic studies. A group of trained research assistants supervised the FFQ administration and interviewed those patients who were not able to answer all of the questions without assistance. Student t test was used to compare group means in form of daily dietary intake, and conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for predetermined dichotomizing cutoff levels.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Food intake characteristics of MHD patients as compared with control patients not receiving dialysis.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between MHD case subjects and nondialytic control subjects were observed between the amounts of daily intake for vitamin C (84 +/- 63 mg/d v 127 +/- 70 mg/d, P = .01), dietary fiber (12 +/- 6 g/d v 18 +/- 11 g/d, P = .02), potassium (2,024 +/- 1,088 mg/d v 2,701 +/- 1,429 mg/d, P = .04), cryptoxanthin (56 +/- 88 microg/d v 140 +/- 118 microg/d, P = .003), and lycopene (2,052 +/- 2,234 microg/d v 4,524 +/- 3,979 microg/d, P = .004). These data indicate that MHD patients had a significantly lower intake of vitamin C, dietary fibers, potassium, and 2 of the carotenoid compounds when compared with individuals not receiving dialysis. Moreover, the daily intake of vitamin B(6) was significantly higher in MHD patients probably because of the high pyridoxine content in Nephrovite. By using the conditional logistic regression analysis, the odds ratios for lower than predetermined cutoff levels in patients receiving dialysis were significant for vitamin C, potassium, and the 2 previously mentioned carotenoids (odds ratio between 3.50 and 7.50, P {\textless} .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving dialysis may consume significantly lower amounts of potassium, vitamin C, and dietary fibers as well as lower amounts of some carotenoids. The FFQ seems to be a useful tool to compare dietary intake of MHD patients with other groups, although it may underestimate the amount of daily protein and energy intake and, hence, may not be an accurate tool for individual assessment of food intake. More studies are required to evaluate the validity of the FFQ in dialysis patients. The lower vitamin C, fiber, and carotenoid intake of MHD patients may be atherogenic. Hence, the hypothesis is proposed that prescribed restrictions in potassium in MHD patients may lead to reduced fruit and vegetable intake, leaving meat and fats as the main source of calories. This may contribute to atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. This hypothesis needs to be evaluated in future studies.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.amjmed.2013.07.023},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary fiber may decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors. We examined trends in dietary fiber intake among diverse US adults between 1999 and 2010, and investigated associations between dietary fiber intake and cardiometabolic risks including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular inflammation, and obesity.
METHODS: Our cross-sectional analysis included 23,168 men and nonpregnant women aged 20+ years from the 1999-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used weighted multivariable logistic regression models to estimate predicted marginal risk ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for the risks of having the metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and obesity associated with quintiles of dietary fiber intake.
RESULTS: Consistently, dietary fiber intake remained below recommended adequate intake levels for total fiber defined by the Institute of Medicine. Mean dietary fiber intake averaged 15.7-17.0 g. Mexican Americans (18.8 g) consumed more fiber than non-Hispanic whites (16.3 g) and non-Hispanic blacks (13.1 g). Comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles of dietary fiber intake, adjusted predicted marginal risk ratios (95\% confidence interval) for the metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and obesity were 0.78 (0.69-0.88), 0.66 (0.61-0.72), and 0.77 (0.71-0.84), respectively. Dietary fiber was associated with lower levels of inflammation within each racial and ethnic group, although statistically significant associations between dietary fiber and either obesity or metabolic syndrome were seen only among whites.
CONCLUSIONS: Low dietary fiber intake from 1999-2010 in the US, and associations between higher dietary fiber and a lower prevalence of cardiometabolic risks suggest the need to develop new strategies and policies to increase dietary fiber intake.},

Mean fiber intake for children/adolescents was 13.2 (±0.1) g/day. Mean fiber intake for adults 19-50 years (y) was 16.1 (±0.2) g/day and for adults 51+ was 16.1 (±0.2) g/day. There were significant increases in fiber intake from 2001-2010 for children/adolescents and for adults 51+y. Mean WG intake for children/adolescents was 0.52 (±0.01) oz eq/day. Mean WG intake for adults 19-50 y was 0.61 (±0.02) oz eq/day and for adults 51+0.86 (±0.02) oz eq/day. There were no significant changes in WG intake for any age group from 2001-2010. The main food groups contributing to dietary fiber intake for children/adolescents were vegetables (16.6\%), grain mixtures (16.3\%), other foods (15.8\%) and fruits (11.3\%). For adults 19+y, the main sources of dietary fiber were vegetables (22.6\%), other foods (14.3\%), grain mixtures (12.0\%) and fruits (11.1\%).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food insecurity refers to limited or uncertain access to food resulting from inadequate financial resources. There is a clear association between food insecurity and obesity among women, but little is known about the relationship between food insecurity and type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether there is an independent association between food insecurity and diabetes.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of the nationally representative, population-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002 waves).
PARTICIPANTS: Four thousand four hundred twenty-three adults {\textgreater} 20 years of age with household incomes {\textless} or = 300\% of the federal poverty level.
MEASUREMENTS: We categorized respondents as food secure, mildly food insecure, or severely food insecure using a well-validated food insecurity scale. Diabetes was determined by self-report or a fasting serum glucose {\textgreater} or = 126 mg/dl.
RESULTS: Diabetes prevalence in the food secure, mildly food insecure, and severely food insecure categories was 11.7\%, 10.0\%, and 16.1\%. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and physical activity level, participants with severe food insecurity were more likely to have diabetes than those without food insecurity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.1, 95\% CI 1.1-4.0, p = .02). This association persisted after further adjusting for body mass index (AOR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.2-3.9, p = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity may act as a risk factor for diabetes. Among adults with food insecurity, increased consumption of inexpensive food alternatives, which are often calorically dense and nutritionally poor, may play a role in this relationship. Future work should address how primary care clinicians can most effectively assist patients with food insecurity to make healthy dietary changes.},

Secondhand smoke was not significantly associated with PAD. Interestingly, a “threshold phenomenon” for tobacco exposure was demonstrated for PAD occurrence. Individuals with serum cotinine {\textgreater}155 ng/mL were at significantly higher risk of having PAD as compared with a nonexistent or a minimal risk below this threshold value. Lack of association between PAD and secondhand smoke exposure in conjunction with the threshold phenomenon described above leads us to speculate existence of striking differences between the systemic circulation and lower extremity vasculature in terms of pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {The role of very-low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (VLCKD) in the long-term management of obesity is not well established. The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether individuals assigned to a VLCKD (i.e. a diet with no more than 50 g carbohydrates/d) achieve better long-term body weight and cardiovascular risk factor management when compared with individuals assigned to a conventional low-fat diet (LFD; i.e. a restricted-energy diet with less than 30\% of energy from fat). Through August 2012, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, ScienceDirect,Scopus, LILACS, SciELO, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature databases were searched, using no date or language restrictions, for randomised controlled trials that assigned adults to a VLCKD or a LFD, with 12 months or more of follow-up. The primary outcome was bodyweight. The secondary outcomes were TAG, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic and diastolic blood pressure,glucose, insulin, HbA1c and C-reactive protein levels. A total of thirteen studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the overall analysis,five outcomes revealed significant results. Individuals assigned to a VLCKD showed decreased body weight (weighted mean difference -0·91 (95\% CI -1·65, -0·17) kg, 1415 patients), TAG (weighted mean difference -0·18 (95\% CI -0·27, -0·08) mmol/l, 1258 patients)and diastolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference -1·43 (95\% CI -2·49, -0·37) mmHg, 1298 patients) while increased HDL-C(weighted mean difference 0·09 (95\% CI 0·06, 0·12) mmol/l, 1257 patients) and LDL-C (weighted mean difference 0·12 (95\% CI 0·04,0·2) mmol/l, 1255 patients). Individuals assigned to a VLCKD achieve a greater weight loss than those assigned to a LFD in the longterm; hence, a VLCKD may be an alternative tool against obesity.},

              Objective
              To determine the effects of diets varying in carbohydrate to fat ratio on total energy expenditure.
            
            
              Design
              Randomized trial.
            
            
              Setting
              Multicenter collaboration at US two sites, August 2014 to May 2017.
            
            
              Participants
              164 adults aged 18-65 years with a body mass index of 25 or more.
            
            
              Interventions
              After 12\% (within 2\%) weight loss on a run-in diet, participants were randomly assigned to one of three test diets according to carbohydrate content (high, 60\%, n=54; moderate, 40\%, n=53; or low, 20\%, n=57) for 20 weeks. Test diets were controlled for protein and were energy adjusted to maintain weight loss within 2 kg. To test for effect modification predicted by the carbohydrate-insulin model, the sample was divided into thirds of pre-weight loss insulin secretion (insulin concentration 30 minutes after oral glucose).
            
            
              Main outcome measures
              The primary outcome was total energy expenditure, measured with doubly labeled water, by intention-to-treat analysis. Per protocol analysis included participants who maintained target weight loss, potentially providing a more precise effect estimate. Secondary outcomes were resting energy expenditure, measures of physical activity, and levels of the metabolic hormones leptin and ghrelin.
            
            
              Results
              Total energy expenditure differed by diet in the intention-to-treat analysis (n=162, P=0.002), with a linear trend of 52 kcal/d (95\% confidence interval 23 to 82) for every 10\% decrease in the contribution of carbohydrate to total energy intake (1 kcal=4.18 kJ=0.00418 MJ). Change in total energy expenditure was 91 kcal/d (95\% confidence interval −29 to 210) greater in participants assigned to the moderate carbohydrate diet and 209 kcal/d (91 to 326) greater in those assigned to the low carbohydrate diet compared with the high carbohydrate diet. In the per protocol analysis (n=120, P{\textless}0.001), the respective differences were 131 kcal/d (−6 to 267) and 278 kcal/d (144 to 411). Among participants in the highest third of pre-weight loss insulin secretion, the difference between the low and high carbohydrate diet was 308 kcal/d in the intention-to-treat analysis and 478 kcal/d in the per protocol analysis (P{\textless}0.004). Ghrelin was significantly lower in participants assigned to the low carbohydrate diet compared with those assigned to the high carbohydrate diet (both analyses). Leptin was also significantly lower in participants assigned to the low carbohydrate diet (per protocol).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model, lowering dietary carbohydrate increased energy expenditure during weight loss maintenance. This metabolic effect may improve the success of obesity treatment, especially among those with high insulin secretion.

While many are successful, the weight loss is often accompanied by a loss in lean body mass. This loss in lean body mass has multiple negative health implications. Therefore, weight loss strategies that protect lean body mass are of value. It is challenging to consume a significant caloric deficit while maintaining lean body mass regardless of macronutrient distribution. Therefore, the efficacy of various dietary supplements on body weight and body composition have been a topic of research interest. Chromium picolinate has been shown to improve body composition by maintaining lean body mass. In this paper we review some common weight loss strategies and dietary supplements with a focus on their impact on body composition and compare them to the effect of chromium picolinate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diet quality is critically important to the prevention of many types of chronic disease. The federal government provides recommendations for optimal diet quality through the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and sets benchmarks for progress toward these recommendations through the Healthy People objectives.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis estimated recent trends in American diet quality and compared those trends to the quality of diets that would meet the Healthy People 2020 objectives and the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans in order to measure progress toward our national nutrition goals.
DESIGN: This analysis used 24-hour recall data from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, between the years of 1999-2000 and 2011-2012, to determine mean intakes of various dietary components for the US population over time. Mean intakes were estimated using the population ratio method, and diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010).
RESULTS: The mean HEI-2010 total score for the US population has increased from 49 in 1999-2000 to 59 in 2011-2012; continuing on that trajectory, it would reach a score of 65 by 2019-2020. A diet that meets the Healthy People 2020 objectives would receive a score of 74 and, by definition, a diet that meets the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans would receive a score of 100. Trends in HEI-2010 component scores vary; all HEI-2010 component scores except sodium have increased over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Diet quality is improving over time, but not quickly enough to meet all of the Healthy People 2020 objectives. Whole fruit and empty calories are the only HEI-2010 components on track to meet their respective Healthy People 2020 targets. Furthermore, the country falls short of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans by a large margin in nearly every component of diet quality assessed by the HEI-2010.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence of financial hardship associated with cancer in the United States and identify characteristics of cancer survivors associated with financial hardship.
METHODS: We identified 1,202 adult cancer survivors diagnosed or treated at ≥ 18 years of age from the 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Experiences With Cancer questionnaire. Material financial hardship was measured by ever (1) borrowing money or going into debt, (2) filing for bankruptcy, (3) being unable to cover one's share of medical care costs, or (4) making other financial sacrifices because of cancer, its treatment, and lasting effects of treatment. Psychological financial hardship was measured as ever worrying about paying large medical bills. We examined factors associated with any material or psychological financial hardship using separate multivariable logistic regression models stratified by age group (18 to 64 and ≥ 65 years).
RESULTS: Material financial hardship was more common in cancer survivors age 18 to 64 years than in those ≥ 65 years of age (28.4\% v 13.8\%; P {\textless} .001), as was psychological financial hardship (31.9\% v 14.7\%, P {\textless} .001). In adjusted analyses, cancer survivors age 18 to 64 years who were younger, female, nonwhite, and treated more recently and who had changed employment because of cancer were significantly more likely to report any material financial hardship. Cancer survivors who were uninsured, had lower family income, and were treated more recently were more likely to report psychological financial hardship. Among cancer survivors ≥ 65 years of age, those who were younger were more likely to report any financial hardship.
CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors, especially the working-age population, commonly experience material and psychological financial hardship.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A cancer diagnosis may provide a 'teachable moment' in cancer recovery. To better understand factors influencing lifestyle choices following diagnosis, we examined associations between time since diagnosis and symptom burden with recommended dietary (e.g., five or more fruit/vegetable servings/day), physical activity (e.g., {\textgreater}150 active min, 3-5 times/week), and smoking behaviors (i.e., eliminate tobacco use) in cancer survivors.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data collected from breast (n = 528), colorectal (n = 106), and prostate (n = 419) cancer survivors following active treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Four regression models were tested for behaviors of interest. Additionally, we assessed symptom burden as a potential moderator and/or mediator between time since diagnosis and behaviors.
RESULTS: Respondents were mostly female (55\%) and non-Hispanic White (68\%) with a mean age of 62.8 ± 11.4 years and mean time since diagnosis of 4.6 ± 3.1 years. In regression models, greater time since diagnosis predicted lower fruit and vegetable consumption (B = -0.05, p = 0.02) and more cigarette smoking (B = 0.06, p = 0.105). Greater symptom burden was a significant negative predictor for physical activity (B = -0.08, p {\textless} .001). We did not find evidence that symptom burden moderated or mediated the association between time since diagnosis and health behaviors.
CONCLUSION: We assessed the prevalence of recommended behaviors in the context of other challenges that survivors face, including time since diagnosis and symptom burden. Our results provide indirect evidence that proximity to a cancer diagnosis may provide a teachable moment to improve dietary and smoking behaviors and that symptom burden may impede physical activity following diagnosis.

	abstract = {Background
              Food insecurity is a global leading public health challenge that affects not only developing countries but also developed countries, including the United States. About 50 million Americans are food insecure. In this study we examined the associations of the adult food insecurity with all‐cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in a nationally representative sample of US adults.
            
            
              Methods and Results
              
                We included 27 188 US adults (age ≥40 years of age) who participated in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2014. Food insecurity status was assessed using the Food Security Survey Module developed by the US Department of Agriculture. Mortality from all causes and cardovascular disease was ascertained through data linkage to the National Death Index through December 31, 2015. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with sampling weights to estimate hazard ratios (
                HR
                s) and 95\% CIs of all‐cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, according to food security status. During 205 389 person‐years of the period, 5039 deaths occurred, including 1084 cardiovascular disease deaths. After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, and dietary and lifestyle factors, participants with very low food security had higher risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, with multivariable‐adjusted
                HR
                s of 1.32 (95\%
                CI
                , 1.07–1.62), and 1.53 (95\% CI, 1.04–2.26), respectively, compared with those with high food security.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Food insecurity is significantly associated with increased risk of excess death from cardiovascular disease and all causes in US adults.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the prevalence of high out-of-pocket burdens among patients with cancer with other chronically ill and well patients, and to examine the sociodemographic characteristics associated with high burdens among patients with cancer.
METHODS: The sample included persons 18 to 64 years of age who received treatment for cancer, taken from a nationally representative sample of the US population from the 2001 to 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We examined the proportion of persons living in families with high out-of-pocket burdens associated with medical spending, including insurance premiums, relative to income, defining high health care (total) burden as spending more than 20\% of income on health care (and premiums).
RESULTS: The risk of high burdens is significantly greater for patients with cancer compared with other chronically ill and well patients. We find that 13.4\% of patients with cancer had high total burdens, in contrast to 9.7\% among those with other chronic conditions and 4.4\% among those without chronic conditions. Among nonelderly persons with cancer, the following were associated with higher out-of-pocket burdens: private nongroup insurance, age 55 to 64 years, non-Hispanic black, never married or widowed, one child or no children, unemployed, lower income, lower education level, living in nonmetropolitan statistical areas, and having other chronic conditions.
CONCLUSION: High burdens may affect treatment choice and deter patients from getting care. Thus, although a detailed patient-physician discussion of costs of care may not be feasible, we believe that an awareness of out-of-pocket burdens among patients with cancer is useful for clinical oncologists.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2013.49.1241},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To present nationally representative estimates of the impact of cancer survivorship on medical expenditures and lost productivity among adults in the United States.
METHODS: Using the 2008 to 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we identified 4,960 cancer survivors and 64,431 individuals without a history of cancer age ≥ 18 years. Direct medical costs were measured using annual health care expenditures and examined by source of payment and service type. Indirect morbidity costs were estimated from lost productivity as a result of employment disability, missed work days, and lost household productivity. We evaluated the economic burden of cancer survivorship by estimating excess costs among cancer survivors, stratified by time since diagnosis (recently diagnosed [≤ 1 year] and previously diagnosed [{\textgreater} 1 year]), compared with individuals without a history of cancer using multivariable regression models stratified by age (18 to 64 and ≥ 65 years), controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: In 2008 to 2010, the annual excess economic burden of cancer survivorship among recently diagnosed cancer survivors was \$16,213 per survivor age 18 to 64 years and \$16,441 per survivor age ≥ 65 years. Among previously diagnosed cancer survivors, the annual excess burden was \$4,427 per survivor age 18 to 64 years and \$4,519 per survivor age ≥ 65 years. Excess medical expenditures composed the largest share of the economic burden among cancer survivors, particularly among those recently diagnosed.
CONCLUSION: The economic impact of cancer survivorship is considerable and is also high years after a cancer diagnosis. Efforts to reduce the economic burden caused by cancer will be increasingly important given the growing population of cancer survivors.},

	abstract = {The number of persons in the United States with a history of cancer has increased from 3 million in 1971 to approximately 13.4 million in 2012, representing 4.6\% of the population. Given the advances in early detection and treatment of cancer and the aging of the U.S. population, the number of cancer survivors is projected to increase by {\textgreater}30\% during the next decade, to approximately 18 million. Cancer survivors face many challenges with medical care follow-up, managing the long-term and late effects of treatments, monitoring for recurrence, and an increased risk for additional cancers. These survivors also face economic challenges, including limitations in work and daily activities, obtaining health insurance coverage and accessing health care, and increasing medical care costs. To estimate annual medical costs and productivity losses among male and female cancer survivors and persons without a cancer history, CDC, along with other organizations, analyzed data from the 2008-2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The results indicate that the economic burden of cancer survivorship is substantial among all survivors. For male cancer survivors, during 2008-2011, average annual medical costs and productivity losses resulting from health problems per person and adjusted to 2011 dollars were significantly higher among cancer survivors than among persons without a cancer history, by \$4,187 and \$1,459, respectively; for females, the estimated annual costs per person were \$3,293 and \$1,330 higher among cancer survivors than among persons without a cancer history, respectively. These findings suggest the need to develop and evaluate health and employment intervention programs aimed at improving outcomes for cancer survivors and their families.},

	abstract = {This paper explains the size and value "anomalies" in stock returns using an economically motivated two-beta model. We break the beta of a stock with the market portfolio into two components, one reflecting news about the market's future cash flows and one reflecting news about the market's discount rates. Intertemporal asset pricing theory suggests that the former should have a higher price of risk; thus beta, like cholesterol, comes in "bad" and "good" varieties. Empirically, we find that value stocks and small stocks have considerably higher cash-flow betas than growth stocks and large stocks, and this can explain their higher average returns. The poor performance of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) since 1963 is explained by the fact that growth stocks and high-past-beta stocks have predominantly good betas with low risk prices.},

	abstract = {Almost fifty million people are food insecure in the United States, which makes food insecurity one of the nation’s leading health and nutrition issues. We examine recent research evidence of the health consequences of food insecurity for children, nonsenior adults, and seniors in the United States. For context, we first provide an overview of how food insecurity is measured in the country, followed by a presentation of recent trends in the prevalence of food insecurity. Then we present a survey of selected recent research that examined the association between food insecurity and health outcomes. We show that the literature has consistently found food insecurity to be negatively associated with health. For example, after confounding risk factors were controlled for, studies found that food-insecure children are at least twice as likely to report being in fair or poor health and at least 1.4 times more likely to have asthma, compared to food-secure children; and foodinsecure seniors have limitations in activities of daily living comparable to those of food-secure seniors fourteen years older. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) substantially reduces the prevalence of food insecurity and thus is critical to reducing negative health outcomes.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.3146},
	abstract = {Background: There are concerns about the degree to which county income level might underlie the stark disparities in cancer death rates among US counties; at the same time, there is uncertainty about the factors that may mediate the disparities.
Objectives: To assess county-level cancer death rates and to identify possible mediators of the association between county-level median incomes and cancer death rates.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using death records from the National Center for Health Statistics in 2014, with data collected and analyzed between October 1, 2016, and July 31, 2017. All US counties and county equivalents were included.
Exposures: County-level median household income.
Main Outcomes and Measures: County-level age-standardized cancer death rate.
Results: In 3135 counties, median incomes ranged from \$22 126 to \$121 250 per year. Low-income counties (median income, \$33 445) vs high-income counties (median income, \$55 780) had higher proportions of residents who were non-Hispanic black, lived in rural areas, or reported poor or fair health. The mean (SD) cancer death rate was 185.9 (24.4) per 100 000 person-years in high-income counties, compared with 204.9 (26.3) and 229.7 (32.9) per 100 000 person-years in medium- and low-income counties, respectively. In mediation models, health risk behaviors (smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity); clinical care factors (unaffordable care and low-quality care); health environments (food insecurity); and health policies (state smoke-free laws and Medicaid payment rates) in aggregate accounted for more than 80\% of the income-related disparity. The strongest possible mediators were food insecurity (explaining 19.1\% [95\% CI, 12.5\%-26.5\%] of the association between county incomes and cancer deaths), low-quality care (17.9\%; 95\% CI, 14.0\%-21.8\%), smoking (12.7\%; 95\% CI, 9.4\%-15.6\%), and physical inactivity (12.2\%; 95\% CI, 9.4\%-15.6\%).
Conclusions and Relevance: There are wide gaps in cancer death rates between low-, medium-, and high-income counties. Future studies are needed to assess whether targeting the possible mediators might ameliorate the substantial socioeconomic cancer disparities.},

	abstract = {This article highlights disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival in relation to race/ethnicity, and census data on poverty in the county or census tract of residence. The incidence and survival data derive from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program; mortality data are from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); data on the prevalence of major cancer risk factors and cancer screening are from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by NCHS. For all cancer sites combined, residents of poorer counties (those with greater than or equal to 20\% of the population below the poverty line) have 13\% higher death rates from cancer in men and 3\% higher rates in women compared with more affluent counties (less than 10\% below the poverty line). Differences in cancer survival account for part of this disparity. Among both men and women, five-year survival for all cancers combined is 10 percentage points lower among persons who live in poorer than in more affluent census tracts. Even when census tract poverty rate is accounted for, however, African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander men and African American and American Indian/Alaskan Native women have lower five-year survival than non-Hispanic Whites. More detailed analyses of selected cancers show large variations in cancer survival by race and ethnicity. Opportunities to reduce cancer disparities exist in prevention (reductions in tobacco use, physical inactivity, and obesity), early detection (mammography, colorectal screening, Pap tests), treatment, and palliative care.},

Unfortunately, most previous work on the RMSEA and its confidence interval has focused on models with a large df. Building on the work of Chen et al. to examine the impact of small df on the RMSEA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation using correctly specified models with varying df and sample size. The results of our investigation indicate that when the cutoff values are used to assess the fit of the properly specified models with small df and small sample size, the RMSEA too often falsely indicates a poor fitting model. We recommend not computing the RMSEA for small df models, especially those with small sample sizes, but rather estimating parameters that were not originally specified in the model.},

Based on a nationally representative sample from the 2004 National Long-Term Care Survey (NLTCS), the study focuses on caregivers to older adults who are currently participating in paid employment ( N = 652). Results from structural equation modeling indicate that work interruptions mediate the relationship between caregivers’ stress and their work performance appraisal. In addition, the support of employers moderates the relationship between employed caregivers’ stress and their work interruptions as well as the relationship between their work interruptions and work performance appraisal. These results point to the need for training supervisors and helping them to understand the potential dual effects of their support on employed caregivers’ work interruptions and performance.},

Ageism, in fact, can influence society's attitudes regarding this population, in addition to impacting the self-perception of elderly people. This, in turn, has consequences for positive outcomes during the aging process. The current research aims to investigate the simultaneous relationships between knowledge, age, anxiety about aging, and stereotypes toward the elderly, as well as their predictive roles with respect to ageism. A self-report questionnaire was administered to 886 participants, with an average age of 35.8 years (Standard Deviation-SD = 14.2), predominantly female (64.8\%). Descriptive and correlational analyses were performed, along with structural equation modeling. Based on the analyses conducted, anxiety about aging and knowledge are antecedents for stereotypes, which in turn, together with the other variables, influence ageism. Increased education about the aging process could help reduce anxiety and stereotypes against the aging among those who are most responsible for prejudice against the elderly. Knowledge of the antecedents of prejudice toward the elderly is fundamental to promoting positive attitudes toward them.},

The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of “close fit” of a model is suggested.},

              Conducting a power analysis can be challenging for researchers who plan to analyze their data using structural equation models (SEMs), particularly when Monte Carlo methods are used to obtain power. In this tutorial, we explain how power calculations without Monte Carlo methods for the χ

              test and the RMSEA tests of (not-)close fit can be conducted using the Shiny app “power4SEM”. power4SEM facilitates power calculations for SEM using two methods that are not computationally intensive and that focus on model fit instead of the statistical significance of (functions of) parameters. These are the method proposed by Satorra and Saris (Psychometrika 50(1), 83–90, 1985) for power calculations of the likelihood ratio test, and that described by MacCallum, Browne, and Sugawara (Psychol Methods 1(2) 130–149, 1996) for RMSEA-based power calculations. We illustrate the use of power4SEM with examples of power analyses for path models, factor models, and a latent growth model.},

	abstract = {When studying the causal effect of drug use in observational data, marginal structural modeling (MSM) can be used to adjust for time-dependent confounders that are affected by previous treatment. The objective of this study was to compare traditional Cox proportional hazard models (with and without time-dependent covariates) with MSM to study causal effects of time-dependent drug use. The example of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins was examined using up to 17.7 years of follow-up from 4,654 participants of the observational prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. In the MSM model, the weight was based on measurements of established cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidity. In general, we could not demonstrate important differences in results from the Cox models and MSM. Results from analysis on duration of statin use suggested that substantial residual confounding by indication was not accounted for during the period shortly after statin initiation. In conclusion, although on theoretical grounds MSM is an elegant technique, lack of data on the precise time-dependent confounders, such as indication of treatment or other considerations of the prescribing physician jeopardizes the calculation of valid weights. Confounding remains a hurdle in observational effectiveness research on preventive drugs with a multitude of prescription determinants.},

	issn = {2333-0872},
	abstract = {Over the past two decades, a steady decline in response rates on national face-to-face surveys has been documented, with steeper declines observed in recent years. The impact of nonresponse on survey estimates is inconsistent and depends on the correlation between response propensity and the survey estimates. To better understand the impact of declining response rates on the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), potential nonresponse bias (NRB) was investigated. NRB was assessed using three approaches: (a) studying variation within the respondent set; (b) benchmarking and comparisons to external data; and (c) comparing alternative weighting adjustments. Because NHANES only samples 30 counties in every 2-year cycle, the sample of counties in any given cycle may be an outlier on some characteristics. Such sampling variability may compound the effects of NRB. For this reason, the representativeness of the 2017-2018 NHANES counties was examined by comparing: (a) the characteristics of the 2017-2018 sampled counties with those from prior cycles; (b) each sampled county with the average of all the counties in the sampling stratum from which that county was selected; and (c) the 2017-2018 counties with 5,000 other samples that could have been drawn under the same sample design using a simulation study. The NRB analyses showed that the 2017-2018 NHANES sample had a lower proportion of college graduates and higher-income individuals compared with prior cycles. Additionally, the 2017-2018 NHANES counties had lower proportions of college graduates and lower mean incomes compared with counties from prior cycles and counties not selected in 2017-2018, which exacerbated the effects of NRB. Weighting adjustments used in prior cycles were not sufficient to address the bias in the 2017-2018 NHANES. Instead, enhanced weighting adjustments for education and income reduced the bias resulting from nonresponse and location sampling variability.},

Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is a commonly used method to correct this bias. It is also used to adjust for unequal sampling fractions in sample surveys. This article is a review of the use of IPW in epidemiological research. We describe how the bias in the complete-case analysis arises and how IPW can remove it. IPW is compared with multiple imputation (MI) and we explain why, despite MI generally being more efficient, IPW may sometimes be preferred. We discuss the choice of missingness model and methods such as weight truncation, weight stabilisation and augmented IPW. The use of IPW is illustrated on data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort.},

	abstract = {A multitude of dietary factors from dietary fat to macro and micronutrients intakes have been associated with breast cancer, yet data are still equivocal. Therefore, utilizing data from the large, multi-year, cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we applied a novel, modern statistical shrinkage technique, logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, to examine the association between dietary intakes in women, ≥50 years, with self-reported breast cancer (n = 286) compared with women without self-reported breast cancer (1144) from the 1999–2010 NHANES cycle. Logistic LASSO regression was used to examine the relationship between twenty-nine variables, including dietary variables from food, as well as well-established/known breast cancer risk factors, and to subsequently identify the most relevant variables associated with self-reported breast cancer. We observed that as the penalty factor (λ) increased in the logistic LASSO regression, well-established breast cancer risk factors, including age (β = 0.83) and parity (β = −0.05) remained in the model. For dietary macro and micronutrient intakes, only vitamin B12 (β = 0.07) was positively associated with self-reported breast cancer. Caffeine (β = −0.01) and alcohol (β = 0.03) use also continued to remain in the model. These data suggest that a diet high in vitamin B12, as well as alcohol use may be associated with self-reported breast cancer. Nonetheless, additional prospective studies should apply more recent statistical techniques to dietary data and cancer outcomes to replicate and confirm the present findings.},

	abstract = {Westernized populations are plagued by a plethora of chronic non-infectious degenerative diseases, termed as "civilization diseases", like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and many more, diseases which are rare or virtually absent in hunter-gatherers and other non-westernized populations. There is a growing awareness that the cause of this amazing discrepancy lies in the profound changes in diet and lifestyle during recent human history. This paper shows that the transition from Paleolithic nutrition to Western diets, along with lack of corresponding genetic adaptations, cause significant distortions of the fine-tuned metabolism that has evolved over millions of years of human evolution in adaptation to Paleolithic diets. With the increasing spread of Western diet and lifestyle worldwide, overweight and civilization diseases are also rapidly increasing in developing countries. It is suggested that the diet-related key changes in the developmental process include an increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, development of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, low-grade inflammation and an abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system, all of which play pivotal roles in the development of diseases of civilization. In addition, diet-related epigenetic changes and fetal programming play an important role. The suggested pathomechanism is also able to explain the well-known but not completely understood close relationship between obesity and the wide range of comorbidities, like type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, etc., as diseases of the same etiopathology. Changing our lifestyle in accordance with our genetic makeup, including diet and physical activity, may help prevent or limit the development of these diseases.},

              Background
              Dietary pattern analysis is a promising approach to understanding the complex relationship between diet and health. While many statistical methods exist, the literature predominantly focuses on classical methods such as dietary quality scores, principal component analysis, factor analysis, clustering analysis, and reduced rank regression. There are some emerging methods that have rarely or never been reviewed or discussed adequately.
            
            
              Methods
              This paper presents a landscape review of the existing statistical methods used to derive dietary patterns, especially the finite mixture model, treelet transform, data mining, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and compositional data analysis, in terms of their underlying concepts, advantages and disadvantages, and available software and packages for implementation.
            
            
              Results
              While all statistical methods for dietary pattern analysis have unique features and serve distinct purposes, emerging methods warrant more attention. However, future research is needed to evaluate these emerging methods’ performance in terms of reproducibility, validity, and ability to predict different outcomes.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Selection of the most appropriate method mainly depends on the research questions. As an evolving subject, there is always scope for deriving dietary patterns through new analytic methodologies.},

	abstract = {Because foods are consumed in combination, it is difficult in observational studies to separate the effects of single foods on the development of diseases. A possible way to examine the combined effect of food intakes is to derive dietary patterns by using appropriate statistical methods. The objective of this study was to apply a new statistical method, reduced rank regression (RRR), that is more flexible and powerful than the classic principal component analysis. RRR can be used efficiently in nutritional epidemiology by choosing disease-specific response variables and determining combinations of food intake that explain as much response variation as possible. The authors applied RRR to extract dietary patterns from 49 food groups, specifying four diabetes-related nutrients and nutrient ratios as responses. Data were derived from a nested German case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam study consisting of 193 cases with incident type 2 diabetes identified until 2001 and 385 controls. The four factors extracted by RRR explained 93.1\% of response variation, whereas the first four factors obtained by principal component analysis accounted for only 41.9\%. In contrast to principal component analysis and other methods, the new RRR method extracted a significant risk factor for diabetes.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer morbidity both in men and in women. However, females over 65 years old show higher mortality and lower 5-year survival rate of colorectal cancer compared to their age-matched male counterparts. The objective of this review is to suggest gender-based innovations to improve colorectal cancer outcomes in females. Women have a higher risk of developing right-sided (proximal) colon cancer than men, which is associated with more aggressive form of neoplasia compared to left-sided (distal) colon cancer. Despite differences in tumor location between women and men, most of scientific researchers do not consider sex specificity for study design and interpretation. Also, colorectal cancer screening guidelines do not distinguish females from male, which may explain the higher frequency of more advanced neoplasia when tumors are first detected and false negative results in colonoscopy in females. Moreover, socio-cultural barriers within females are present to delay screening and diagnosis. Few studies, among studies that included both men and women, have reported sex-specific estimates of dietary risk factors which are crucial to establish cancer prevention guidelines despite sex- and gender-associated differences in nutrient metabolism and dietary practices. Furthermore, anti-cancer drug use for colorectal cancer treatment can cause toxicity to the reproductive system, and gender-specific recurrence and survival rates are reported. Therefore, by understanding sex- and gender-related biological and socio-cultural differences in colorectal cancer risk, gender-specific strategies for screening, treatment and prevention protocols can be established to reduce the mortality and improve the quality of life.},

	abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis might work well in elucidating the major dietary patterns prevailing in specific study populations. However, patterns extracted in one study population and their associations with disease risk cannot be reproduced with this data-specific method in other study populations. To construct less population-dependent pattern variables of similar content as original exploratory patterns, we proposed to derive so-called simplified pattern variables. They represent the sum of the unweighted standardised food variables which loaded high at the pattern of interest. Data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study suggest that these simplified pattern variables might adequately approximate factor analysis-based dietary patterns. A simplified pattern variable based on the six highest loading food variables showed a correlation {\textgreater}0·95 with the originally derived factor score, which consisted of forty-seven food variables. Moreover, simplified pattern variables might adequately approximate patterns across different study populations. A simplified pattern variable showed similar factor loadings, ranging from 0·34 to 0·52, as well as similar associations with nutrient intake as a ‘western’ pattern originally reported from an US study population. These simplified pattern variables can subsequently be used to study pattern associations with disease risk, especially in multi-centre studies. It is therefore an approach that might overcome one of the most frequently claimed limitations of factor analyses applied in epidemiology: their non-comparable risk estimates.},

	abstract = {Background: Childhood obesity is one of the foremost threats to population health in the United States (U.S.) leading to the emergence of co-morbidities and increased healthcare cost. We explore the influence of selected social determinants of health (SDOH) on overweight and obesity among U.S. children.
Methods: We utilized the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) 2016-17 dataset for this analysis. Overweight was defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 85th to{\textless}95th, while obesity was defined as BMI ≥95th percentile for age and sex. Based on the literature and pathway plausibility, we examined several SDOH variables as predictors of childhood overweight or obesity in the US. Survey log-binomial regression models were built to generate prevalence ratio (PR) estimates to capture the associations between SDOH and overweight or obesity.
Results: About 30.6 million children were surveyed of which 9.5 million (31.0\%) were either overweight or obese. The likelihood of obesity was elevated among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic children (PR = 1.53; 95\% CI = 1.01-2.31) and (PR = 1.50; 95\% CI = 1.18-1.90) respectively. Overweight was more frequent in younger children, children of single parents, and children who lived in a neighborhood with no amenities. Parental attainment of college education, health insurance coverage, female gender, and language spoken in home other than Spanish were protective against overweight or obesity.
Conclusions and Global Health Implications: SDOH represent markers of overweight or obesity in children. We recommend the development of innovative interventions using SDOH risk and protective pathways as guide to address the current epidemic of childhood overweight and obesity.},

	doi = {10.4081/jphr.2021.2049},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has infected millions and killed tens of thousands of people. Public health measures put in place by governments are essential to the success of controlling this disease. However, governments may not feel as incentivized to implement these measures when deaths are not rising along with cases. However, it is known that a delay exists between the time of infection and the time of death. This study attempted to find how long that lag is and how the age of people infected may affect that lag.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive and correlational study was carried out to investigate the length of the lag and the relationship between lag and age.
RESULTS: The average lag between daily Covid-19 cases and deaths was 8.053 days with a standard deviation of 4.116 days for nineteen regions. After excluding data from three more regions due to unavailable age data, the regression yielded an equation of lag = 14.015 - 0.153 (\% cases above 60) with a p-value of 0.066. Because the p-value of 0.066 is lower than the 0.10 significance level, there is evidence that a relationship exists between the lag and the age of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that regions must remain vigilant when Covid-19 cases rapidly increase without similar increases in deaths since there exists a significant lag between the two. Additionally, a younger demographic of cases may lead to an increased lag, further pushing regions into a false sense of security that should be avoided.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This report details development of the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics' (NCHS) Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties (update of the 2006 NCHS scheme) and applies it to health measures to demonstrate urban-rural health differences.
METHODS: The methodology used to construct the 2013 NCHS scheme was the same as that used for the 2006 NCHS scheme, but 2010 census-based data were used rather than 2000 census-based data. All U.S. counties and county-equivalent entities are assigned to one of six levels (four metropolitan and two nonmetropolitan) based on: 1) their February 2013 Office of Management and Budget designation as metropolitan, micropolitan, or noncore; 2) for metropolitan counties, the population size of the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) to which they belong; and 3) for counties in MSAs of 1 million or more, the location of principal city populations within the MSA. The 2013 and 2006 NCHS schemes were applied to data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to illustrate differences in selected health measures by urbanization level and to assess the magnitude of differences between estimates from the two schemes.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: County urban-rural assignments under the 2013 NCHS scheme are very similar to those under the 2006 NCHS scheme. Application of the updated scheme to NVSS and NHIS data demonstrated the continued usefulness of the six categories for assessing and monitoring health differences among communities across the full urbanization spectrum. Residents of large central and large fringe metro counties differed substantially on many health measures, illustrating the importance of continuing to separate these counties. Residents of large fringe metro counties generally fared better than residents of less urban counties. Estimates obtained from the 2013 and 2006 schemes were similar.},

	abstract = {PROBLEM/CONDITION: Persons living in rural areas are recognized as a health disparity population because the prevalence of disease and rate of premature death are higher than for the overall population of the United States. Surveillance data about health-related behaviors are rarely reported by urban-rural status, which makes comparisons difficult among persons living in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties.
REPORTING PERIOD: 2013.
DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed landline- and cellular-telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults aged ≥18 years residing in the United States. BRFSS collects data on health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, access to health care, and use of preventive health services related to the leading causes of death and disability. BRFSS data were analyzed for 398,208 adults aged ≥18 years to estimate the prevalence of five self-reported health-related behaviors (sufficient sleep, current nonsmoking, nondrinking or moderate drinking, maintaining normal body weight, and meeting aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations) by urban-rural status. For this report, rural is defined as the noncore counties described in the 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties.
RESULTS: Approximately one third of U.S. adults practice at least four of these five behaviors. Compared with adults living in the four types of metropolitan counties (large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, and small metropolitan), adults living in the two types of nonmetropolitan counties (micropolitan and noncore) did not differ in the prevalence of sufficient sleep; had higher prevalence of nondrinking or moderate drinking; and had lower prevalence of current nonsmoking, maintaining normal body weight, and meeting aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations. The overall age-adjusted prevalence of reporting at least four of the five health-related behaviors was 30.4\%. The prevalence among the estimated 13.3 million adults living in noncore counties was lower (27.0\%) than among those in micropolitan counties (28.8\%), small metropolitan counties (29.5\%), medium metropolitan counties (30.5\%), large fringe metropolitan counties (30.2\%), and large metropolitan centers (31.7\%).
INTERPRETATION: This is the first report of the prevalence of these five health-related behaviors for the six urban-rural categories. Nonmetropolitan counties have lower prevalence of three and clustering of at least four health-related behaviors that are associated with the leading chronic disease causes of death. Prevalence of sufficient sleep was consistently low and did not differ by urban-rural status.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Chronic disease prevention efforts focus on improving the communities, schools, worksites, and health systems in which persons live, learn, work, and play. Evidence-based strategies to improve health-related behaviors in the population of the United States can be used to reach the Healthy People 2020 objectives for these five self-reported health-related behaviors (sufficient sleep, current nonsmoking, nondrinking or moderate drinking, maintaining normal body weight, and meeting aerobic leisure time physical activity recommendations). These findings suggest an ongoing need to increase public awareness and public education, particularly in rural counties where prevalence of these health-related behaviors is lowest.},

            Objectives
            
              United States government scientists estimate that COVID-19 may kill tens of thousands of Americans. Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM
              2.5
              ) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States.
            
          
          
            Design
            A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data.
          
          
            Data sources
            COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98\% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center.
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            
              We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM
              2.5
              as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state’s issuance of stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              We found that an increase of only 1
              μ
              g/m
              3
              in PM
              2.5
              is associated with an 8\% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2\%, 15\%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses.
            
          
          
            Conclusions
            
              A small increase in long-term exposure to PM
              2.5
              leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.

              What is already known on this topic
              
                
                  
                    Long-term exposure to PM
                    2.5
                    is linked to many of the comorbidities that have been associated with poor prognosis and death in COVID-19 patients, including cardiovascular and lung disease.
                  
                
                
                  
                    PM
                    2.5
                    exposure is associated with increased risk of severe outcomes in patients with certain infectious respiratory diseases, including influenza, pneumonia, and SARS.
                  
                
                
                  Air pollution exposure is known to cause inflammation and cellular damage, and evidence suggests that it may suppress early immune response to infection.
                
              
            
            
              What this study adds
              
                
                  
                    This is the first nationwide study of the relationship between historical exposure to air pollution exposure and COVID-19 death rate, relying on data from more than 3,000 counties in the United States. The results suggest that long-term exposure to PM
                    2.5
                    is associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates, after adjustment for a wide range of socioeconomic, demographic, weather, behavioral, epidemic stage, and healthcare-related confounders.
                  
                
                
                  This study relies entirely on publicly available data and fully reproducible, public code to facilitate continued investigation of these relationships by the broader scientific community as the COVID-19 outbreak evolves and more data become available.

	abstract = {A case-control interview study involving 227 women in North Carolina with oral cavity or pharyngeal cancer and 405 matched controls showed a protective effect of a usual adult diet high in fruits and vegetables. The relative risks of 0.65 for moderate and 0.52 for high (relative to 1.0 for infrequent) consumption of fruits and vegetables were statistically significant and remained after controlling for demographic characteristics, tobacco and alcohol use, relative weight, and intake of other food groups. Risks were lower with higher bread and cereal intake but higher for those women with the lightest weights, adjusted for height. The inverse associations between oral and pharyngeal cancer and intake of fruits and vegetables and intake of breads and cereals could not be attributed to an association with general nutritional status, since meat and fish consumption was related to an increased risk of oral and pharynx cancer. Moreover, dairy and egg consumption was generally unrelated to cancer risk. The reduction in risk with greater fruit and vegetable consumption is consistent with the hypothesis that vitamin C and/or beta-carotene intake is associated with a reduced risk of oral and pharyngeal cancer.},

	abstract = {Dietary intake is understood to contribute to nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of four a priori-defined diet quality indices on the presence of NIS 1 year following diagnosis using data on 323 participants from the University of Michigan Head and Neck Specialized Program of Research Excellence (UM-SPORE). Pretreatment dietary intake was measured before treatment initiation using a food frequency questionnaire. NIS were measured along seven subdomains. Multivariable binary logistic regression models were constructed to evaluate relationships between pretreatment scores on a priori-defined diet quality indices (AHEI-2010, aMED, DASH, and a low-carbohydrate score) and the presence of individual symptoms in addition to a composite “symptom summary score” 1-year postdiagnosis. There were several significant associations between different indices and individual NIS. For the symptom summary score, there were significant inverse associations observed for aMED (ORQ5-Q1: 0.36, 95\% CI: 0.14–0.88, ptrend = 0.04) and DASH (ORQ5-Q1: 0.38, 95\% CI: 0.15–0.91, ptrend = 0.02) and the presence of NIS 1-year postdiagnosis. Higher adherence to the aMED and DASH diet quality indices before treatment may reduce NIS burden at 1-year postdiagnosis.},

	doi = {10.1200/OP.21.00440},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated the association between race and FT among previous patients with cancer. Studies show that patients with cancer experience financial toxicity (FT) because of their cancer treatment.
METHODS: Data on individuals with a cancer history were collected in this cross-sectional study during 2012, 2014, and 2017, from the US Health Information National Trends Survey. This survey is conducted by mail with monetary compensation as an incentive. We specifically assessed responses to two questions: Has cancer hurt you financially? Have you been denied health insurance because of cancer? Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations between these questions and race.
RESULTS: Of 10,592 individuals participating, 1,328 men and women (12.5\%) with a cancer history were assessed. Compared with Blacks, Whites were found to have a higher rate of insurance (95.4\% v 90.0\%), were more likely to receive cancer treatment (93.9\% v 85\%), and had a higher rate of surgical treatment than Blacks (77\% v 60\%), Hispanics (55\%), and others (77\%, 60\%, 55\%, and 74.2\%, respectively, P {\textless} .001). On multivariable analysis, Blacks were more than five times as likely to be denied insurance (odds ratio, 5.003; 95\% CI, 2.451 to 10.213; P {\textless} .001) and more than twice as likely to report being hurt financially because of cancer (odds ratio, 2.448; 95\% CI, 1.520 to 3.941; P {\textless} .001) than Whites. Of all cancer groups analyzed (genitourinary, gynecologic, gastrointestinal, and breast), genitourinary malignancies were the only group in which the rate of reporting being hurt financially varied in a statistically significant manner (Whites 36.7\%, Hispanics 62.5\%, and Blacks 59.3\%, P = .004).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that race is significantly associated with FT because of cancer. Awareness of racial inequality with regards to FT should be raised among health care workers.},

It outlines historical and contemporary evidence of inequalities in pandemics-drawing on international research into the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 and the emerging international estimates of socio-economic, ethnic and geographical inequalities in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. It then examines how these inequalities in COVID-19 are related to existing inequalities in chronic diseases and the social determinants of health, arguing that we are experiencing a syndemic pandemic It then explores the potential consequences for health inequalities of the lockdown measures implemented internationally as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the likely unequal impacts of the economic crisis. The essay concludes by reflecting on the longer-term public health policy responses needed to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not increase health inequalities for future generations.},

The clinical and research capacity across the USA is unparalleled, yet compared to other high and even some middle-income countries, the average health indicators of the population remain suboptimal in 2020, a finding at least in part explained by inequity in healthcare access. In this context, COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a major threat to the public's health. While it was initially thought that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 would be the great equaliser as it would not discriminate, it is clear that COVID-19 incidence and mortality have rapidly reinforced health disparities drawn by historical and contemporary inequities. Here, we synthesise the data highlighting specific risks among particular marginalised and under-resourced communities including those in jails, prisons and detention centers, immigrants and the undocumented, people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness across the USA. The drivers of these disparities are pervasive structural risks including limited access to preventive services, inability to comply with physical distancing recommendations, underlying health disparities and intersecting stigmas particularly affecting racial and ethnic minorities across the country, including African Americans, Latinx Americans and Native Americans. Advancing the COVID-19 response, saving lives and restarting the economy necessitate rapidly addressing these inequities rather than ignoring and even reinforcing them.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: There is a growing concern about the COVID-19 epidemic intensifying in rural areas in the United States (U.S.). In this study, we described the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural and urban counties in the U.S.
METHODS: Using data from April 1 to November 12, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, we estimated COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and conducted comparisons between urban and rural areas in three time periods at the national level, and in states with higher and lower COVID-19 incidence rates.
RESULTS: Results at the national level showed greater COVID-19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. at the beginning of the epidemic. However, the intensity of the epidemic has shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas. In particular, high incidence states located in the Mid-west of the country had more than 3,400 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people compared to 1,284 cases per 100,000 people in urban counties nationwide during the third period (August 30 to November 12).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection rates and mortality in rural areas. Infection prevention and control efforts including healthcare capacity should be scaled up in these vulnerable rural areas.},

	abstract = {Many adult cancer patients present one or more physical comorbidities. Besides interfering with treatment and prognosis, physical comorbidities could also increase the already heightened psychological risk of cancer patients. To test this possibility, we investigated the relationship between physical comorbidities with depression symptoms in a sample of 2073 adult cancer survivors drawn from the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2007–2018) in the U.S. Based on information regarding 16 chronic conditions, the number of comorbidities diagnosed before and after the cancer diagnosis was calculated. The number of comorbidities present at the moment of cancer diagnosis was significantly related to depression risk in recent but not in long-term survivors. Recent survivors who suffered multimorbidity had 3.48 (95\% CI 1.26–9.55) times the odds of reporting significant depressive symptoms up to 5 years after the cancer diagnosis. The effect of comorbidities was strongest among survivors of breast cancer. The comorbidities with strongest influence on depression risk were stroke, kidney disease, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and arthritis. Information about comorbidities is usually readily available and could be useful in streamlining depression screening or targeting prevention efforts in cancer patients and survivors. A multidimensional model of the interaction between cancer and other physical comorbidities on mental health is proposed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of cancer survivorship is increasing. In this study, we provide contemporary population-based estimates and projections of the overall and site-specific cancer-attributable medical care costs in the United States.
METHODS: We identified survivors aged ≥65 years diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database and used 2007 to 2013 claims to estimate costs by cancer site, phases of care, and stage at diagnosis. Annualized average cancer-attributable costs for medical care (Medicare Parts A and B) and oral prescription drugs (Medicare Part D) were estimated by subtracting costs between patients with cancer and matched controls. Costs are reported in 2019 U.S. dollars. We combined phase-specific attributable costs with prevalence projections to estimate national costs from 2015 through 2030.
RESULTS: Overall annualized average costs were highest in the end-of-life-cancer death phase, followed by the initial and continuing phases (medical care: \$105,500, \$41,800, and \$5,300 and oral prescription drugs: \$4,200, \$1,800, \$1,100, respectively). There was considerable variation in costs by cancer site and stage. Overall national costs in 2015 were \$183 billion and projected to increase 34\% to \$246 billion by 2030, based only on population growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Phase of care cancer-attributable cost estimates by cancer site and stage are key inputs for simulation models and cost-effectiveness analyses.
IMPACT: The national cancer-attributed medical care costs in the United States are substantial and projected to increase dramatically by 2030, due to population changes alone, reflecting the rising burden of cancer care among cancer survivors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With rising costs of cancer care, this study aims to estimate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, medical financial hardship intensity and financial sacrifices due to cancer in the United States.
METHODS: We identified 963 cancer survivors from the 2016 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey - Experiences with Cancer. Medical financial hardship due to cancer was measured in material (e.g., filed for bankruptcy), psychological (e.g., worry about paying bills and finances), and behavioral (e.g., delaying or forgoing care due to cost) domains. Nonmedical financial sacrifices included changes in spending and use of savings. Multivariable logistic models were used to identify characteristics associated with hardship intensity and sacrifices stratified by age group (18-64 or 65+ years).
RESULTS: Among cancer survivors ages 18 to 64 years, 53.6\%, 28.4\%, and 11.4\% reported at least one, two, or all three domains of hardship, respectively. Among survivors ages 65+ years, corresponding percentages were 42.0\%, 12.7\%, and 4.0\%, respectively. Moreover, financial sacrifices due to cancer were more common in survivors ages 18 to 64 years (54.2\%) than in survivors 65+ years (38.4\%; P {\textless} 0.001). Factors significantly associated with hardship intensity in multivariable analyses included low income and educational attainment, racial/ethnic minority, comorbidity, lack of private insurance coverage, extended employment change, and recent cancer treatment. Most were also significantly associated with financial sacrifices.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical financial hardship and financial sacrifices are substantial among cancer survivors in the United States, particularly for younger survivors.
IMPACT: Efforts to mitigate financial hardship for cancer survivors are warranted, especially for those at high risk.},

              Background
              Food insecurity affects millions of Americans and college students are especially vulnerable. Little is known about the relation of food insecurity with weight status and dietary intake during this critical phase of emerging adulthood.
            
            
              Objectives
              We aimed to examine the sex-specific associations of food insecurity with obesity and dietary intake among college students. The study also explored these associations by meal plan (MP) enrollment.
            
            
              Methods
              This cross-sectional study included 683 second-year students at 8 universities in the United States. Food security status and dietary intake were assessed using the USDA Adult Food Security Survey and the Dietary Screener Questionnaire, respectively. On-site anthropometrics were measured by researchers.
            
            
              Results
              The prevalence of food insecurity at the universities ranged from 19.0\% to 34.1\% with a mean of 25.4\% for the entire sample. Compared with high food security, marginal food security and food insecurity were associated with 3.16 (95\% CI: 1.55, 6.46) and 5.13 (95\% CI: 2.63, 10.00) times increased odds of obesity, respectively, exhibiting a dose–response relation. Food insecurity remained a significant predictor of obesity among both sexes after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Food-insecure (FI) students had a significantly lower intake of fruits and vegetables and higher intake of added sugars than food-secure (FS) students. Obesity rate and added sugars consumption were higher among FI students with MPs than among FI students lacking MPs and FS students regardless of MP status. Among students with MPs, FS students had a higher intake of fruits and vegetables than FI students.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Food insecurity was associated with obesity and poor dietary intake among both sexes. Although MP subsidies may be a reasoned approach to combat food insecurity, it should be coupled with efforts to assist students in making healthy food choices.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Approximately 6·5 million US children live in food-insecure households, meaning that they have restrained access to the types and amounts of foods they usually eat. The nutrient demands of growth and general sub-par dietary intake of US children by age highlight the importance and difficulty of attaining recommended amounts of critical dietary components to promote health and prevent disease. Evaluation of the evidence for a relationship of food insecurity with key dietary outcomes for the specific stages of child growth at 1–5 years, 6–11 years and 12–19 years has not been previously documented. Bradford Hill criteria of strength, consistency and dose–response were applied to aid evaluation. A comprehensive search of original research on US children using food-security assessment measures indexed to January 2017 was completed and identified sixteen studies that evaluated the relationship of food insecurity with key dietary outcomes. Evidence for a strong, consistent and dose–response relationship of food insecurity with lower vegetable intake compared with food security was determined among children aged 1–5 years and strong and consistent evidence of higher added sugar intake among food-insecure children aged 6–11 years compared with food-secure children was apparent. Adolescent-focused evidence was sparse but revealed adolescence as the paediatric age stage where food insecurity has the most potential for negative impact on child dietary intake. A discussion of future research opportunities includes strengthening the evidence through longitudinal study designs, inclusion of additional nutrients of concern, and stronger mitigation of bias and error.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Education is a crucial social determinant of health. Food insecurity can be detrimental to children's academic achievement, potentially perpetuating a cycle of poverty and food insecurity. We aimed to assess the relationship between food insecurity and academic achievement in Canadian school-aged children.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of children and parents. Parents completed the short-form Household Food Security Survey Module and questions about income and education level (socio-economic status). Children completed FFQ. Data were prospectively linked to children's performance on standardized exams written one year later. Mixed-effect logistic regression was employed to assess the relationship between food insecurity and likelihood of meeting academic expectations adjusting for socio-economic status, diet quality and potential confounders.
SETTING: Nova Scotia, Canada in 2011-2012.
SUBJECTS: Students (n 4105) in grade 5 (10-11 years; 2167 girls) and their parents.
RESULTS: Low food security was reported by 9·8 \% of households; very low food security by 7·1 \% of households. Students from low-income households and reporting poor diet quality were less likely to do well in school. Children who lived in households reporting very low food security had 0·65 times the odds (OR=0·65; 95 \% CI 0·44, 0·96) of meeting expectations for reading and 0·62 times the odds (OR=0·62; 95 \% CI 0·45, 0·86) of meeting expectations for mathematics.
CONCLUSIONS: Very low household insecurity is associated with poor academic achievement among children in Nova Scotia.},

              Objective
              The present review aimed to identify and synthesize literature on household food insecurity with respect to whether the respondent was male or female.
            
            
              Design
              
                A systematic review of prevalence studies followed by a meta-analysis was conducted between 28 August 2014 and 19 October 2014 in seven electronic databases. The search was updated in April 2016. The included studies used experience-based measures to assess household food insecurity. Dichotomous measures of food insecurity were used. Pooled odds ratios of household food insecurity prevalence in women
                v
                . men were obtained through random-effect modelling. Quality assessment, publication bias diagnostics and subgroup analysis were also performed.
              
            
            
              Setting
              Population-based studies (i.e. non-clinical populations).
            
            
              Subjects
              Participants aged 18 years or over.
            
            
              Results
              
                Out of the 5145 articles initially identified, forty-two studies with a total population of 233 153 were included. In general, results showed that the odds for household food insecurity was 40 \% higher in studies where women were the respondent (95 \% CI 1·27, 1·54;
                P
                {\textless}0·001). Besides, subgroup analysis revealed that female-headed households were 75\% (95 \% CI 49–96\%) more likely to be food insecure than male-headed households.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results confirm the existence of gender differences in reporting household food insecurity. Furthermore, they indicate that households headed by women constitute a segment of the population that is particularly vulnerable to food insecurity.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Integrative explanations of why obesity is more prevalent in some sectors of the human population than others are lacking. Here, we outline and evaluate one candidate explanation, the insurance hypothesis (IH). The IH is rooted in adaptive evolutionary thinking: The function of storing fat is to provide a buffer against shortfall in the food supply. Thus, individuals should store more fat when they receive cues that access to food is uncertain. Applied to humans, this implies that an important proximate driver of obesity should be food insecurity rather than food abundance per se. We integrate several distinct lines of theory and evidence that bear on this hypothesis. We present a theoretical model that shows it is optimal to store more fat when food access is uncertain, and we review the experimental literature from non-human animals showing that fat reserves increase when access to food is restricted. We provide a meta-analysis of 125 epidemiological studies of the association between perceived food insecurity and high body weight in humans. There is a robust positive association, but it is restricted to adult women in high-income countries. We explore why this could be in light of the IH and our theoretical model. We conclude that although the IH alone cannot explain the distribution of obesity in the human population, it may represent a very important component of a pluralistic explanation. We also discuss insights it may offer into the developmental origins of obesity, dieting-induced weight gain, and anorexia nervosa.},

              Purpose:
              The association between food insecurity and health-related quality of life (QOL) of racial/ethnic minority patients with cancer has not been examined. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between food insecurity and health-related QOL reported by racial/ethnic minority patients with cancer.
            
            
              Methods:
              A consecutive sample of 1,390 underserved ethnic minority patients receiving cancer care in 10 cancer clinics and hospitals in New York City participated in this study. Health-related QOL was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and food security was assessed by the US Department of Agriculture Core Food Security Module.
            
            
              Results:
              Of the 1,390 patients, 581 (41.8\%) were classified as food secure, 571 (41.1\%) with low food security, and 238 (17.1\%) with very low food security. Health-related QOL decreased with each lower food security level. Patient self-reported physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being subscale scores decrease significantly with increasing food insecurity. After controlling for demographic and medical-related factors, the decreases in QOL, physical, functional, social and emotional well-being scores with increasing food insecurity remained significant.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Food insecurity was associated with lower QOL in this sample of underserved racial/ethnic minority patients with cancer. Underserved ethnic minority patients diagnosed with cancer are a vulnerable patient population, at significant risk for inadequate food access and the related lower QOL.},

              Background
              Consuming a diet rich in plant-based foods (PBFs) may be protective for risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and chronic disease. However, the impact of consuming healthy versus all types of PBF on MetS is unknown.
            
            
              Methods
              The relationship between consumption of PBF (both healthy and all) was examined using data from the 2015 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The amount of PBFs consumed was calculated as average daily servings, whereas dichotomous MetS variables were based on the National Cholesterol Education Adult Program Treatment Panel III (2005). After weighting and multiple imputation, adjusted associations were examined using logistic regression and marginal probabilities.
            
            
              Results
              Consumption of healthy PBF was significantly associated with reduced risk for elevated waist circumference (P = 0.017; odds ratio, OR 0.96, 95\% confidence interval, CI 0.94–0.98) and MetS (P = 0.006; OR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.93–0.99). Interactions revealed significant protective effects for females who were \${\textbackslash}ge\$ 60 years.
            
            
              Conclusions
              In the adjusted model, a 1-unit increase in daily servings of healthy PBF was associated with a 4\% lower risk for prevalence of elevated waist circumference and a 4\% decrease in risk for prevalence of MetS. Increasing consumption of PBF may offer a viable strategy for reducing risk of MetS.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0220857},
	abstract = {Objective Although there is anecdotal evidence of ageism occurring at both the structural level (in which societal institutions reinforce systematic bias against older persons) and individual level (in which older persons take in the negative views of aging of their culture), previous systematic reviews have not examined how both levels simultaneously influence health. Thus, the impact of ageism may be underestimated. We hypothesized that a comprehensive systematic review would reveal that these ageism levels adversely impact the health of older persons across geography, health outcomes, and time. Method A literature search was performed using 14 databases with no restrictions on region, language, and publication type. The systematic search yielded 13,691 papers for screening, 638 for full review, and 422 studies for analyses. Sensitivity analyses that adjusted for sample size and study quality were conducted using standardized tools. The study protocol is registered (PROSPERO CRD42018090857). Results Ageism led to significantly worse health outcomes in 95.5\% of the studies and 74.0\% of the 1,159 ageism-health associations examined. The studies reported ageism effects in all 45 countries, 11 health domains, and 25 years studied, with the prevalence of significant findings increasing over time (p {\textless} .0001). A greater prevalence of significant ageism-health findings was found in less-developed countries than more-developed countries (p = .0002). Older persons who were less educated were particularly likely to experience adverse health effects of ageism. Evidence of ageism was found across the age, sex, and race/ethnicity of the targeters (i.e., persons perpetrating ageism). Conclusion The current analysis which included over 7 million participants is the most comprehensive review of health consequences of ageism to date. Considering that the analysis revealed that the detrimental impact of ageism on older persons’ health has been occurring simultaneously at the structural and individual level in five continents, our systematic review demonstrates the pernicious reach of ageism.},

The aim of this review was to systematically examine the age-related inclusion criteria distribution of participants in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of low back pain (LBP) interventions and to investigate if this distribution pattern changes over time. Methods We identified, in PubMed, 1,047 RCTs on nonspecific LBP published since 1992, of which a random sample of 400 was assessed for inclusion in the review. Included studies were grouped according to treatment type. Data were extracted on year of publication, types of treatment, total number of participants, age inclusion criteria, and age of included participants. Results A total of 274 RCTs published between 1992 and 2010 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 41.6\% (n = 114) of the included trials excluded people ages {\textgreater}65 years. The pooled mean age of participants was 44.3 years (95\% confidence interval 42.4-46.3); the pooled minimum age for inclusion was 19.8 years and the pooled maximum age for inclusion was 65.4 years. We found no trend of including older participants in RCTs on LBP over time. Conclusion Despite an aging population around the globe, older adults are largely excluded from RCTs evaluating management of LBP, and there is no evidence of change in this practice over the last 2 decades.

In this study, we calculated the costs of ageism on health conditions for all persons aged 60 years or older in the United States during 1 year. Research Design and Materials: The ageism predictors were discrimination aimed at older persons, negative age stereotypes, and negative self-perceptions of aging. Health care costs of ageism were computed by combining analyses of the impact of the predictors with comprehensive health care spending data in 1 year for the eight most-expensive health conditions, among all Americans aged 60 years or older. As a secondary analysis, we computed the number of these health conditions experienced due to ageism. Results: It was found that the 1-year cost of ageism was \$63 billion, or one of every seven dollars spent on the 8 health conditions (15.4\%), after adjusting for age and sex as well as removing overlapping costs from the three predictors. Also according to our model, ageism resulted in 17.04 million cases of these health conditions. Discussion and Implications: This is the first study to identify the economic cost that ageism imposes on health. The findings suggest that a reduction of ageism would not only have a monetary benefit for society, but also have a health benefit for older persons.},

The authors combine the outcomes reported in these studies using a random effects meta-analysis, assuming that there would be differences in effect sizes across studies. The meta-analysis resulted in an overall significant effect of subjective aging (likelihood ratio = 1.429; 95\% confidence interval = 1.273-1.604; p {\textless} .001). The analyses revealed heterogeneity, with stronger effects for studies with a shorter period of follow-up, for studies of health versus survival, for studies with younger participants (average age of the studies varies between 57 and 85 years with a median of 63 years), and for studies in welfare systems where state provisions of welfare are minimal. However, effects did not vary either across different operationalizations of subjective aging or by study quality. Subjective aging has a small significant effect on health, health behaviors, and survival. Further theoretical conceptualizations and empirical studies are needed to determine how subjective aging contributes to health and survival.},

The present review and meta-analyses examine 22 published and 10 unpublished articles, including 82 effect sizes (N = 3882) investigating ABST on older people's (Mage = 69.5) performance. The analysis revealed a significant small-to-medium effect of ABST (d = .28) and important moderators of the effect size. Specifically, older adults are more vulnerable to ABST when (a) stereotype-based rather than fact-based manipulations are used (d = .52); (b) when performance is tested using cognitive measures (d = .36); and (c) occurs reliably when the dependent variable is measured proximally to the manipulation. The review raises important theoretical and methodological issues, and areas for future research.},

	abstract = {Background: Upon encountering older adults, individuals display varying degrees of prosocial attitudes and behaviors. While some display compassion and empathy, others draw away and wish to maintain their distance from them. The current study examined if and how ageist attitudes influence the association between the sight of physical incapacity in older age and compassionate reactions toward them. We predicted that ageist attitudes would interfere with the ability to respond to them with compassion. Methods: Young adults (N = 149, ages 19-29) were randomly distributed into two experimental conditions, each viewing a short video portraying different aspects of older adult physicality; one group viewed older adults displaying incapacitated behavior, and the other viewed fit behavior. Participants subsequently filled out scales assessing aging anxieties, and ageist and compassionate attitudes. Results: Ageism was associated with reduced compassion toward the figures. Moreover, viewing incapacitated older adults led to increased concern toward them and perceived efficacy in helping them. However, significant interactions proved that higher scores of ageism in response to the videos led to increased need for distance and reduced efficacy toward incapacitated adults, an effect not observed among subjects with lower ageism scores. Conclusions: Ageism seems to be a factor which disengages individuals from older adults displaying fragility, leading them to disregard social norms which dictate compassion. The results are discussed from the framework of terror management theory, as increased mortality salience and death-related thoughts could have led to the activation of negative attitudes which, in turn, reduce compassion.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study describes the development of a short version of the Expectations Regarding Aging Survey (ERA-38), a 38-item survey measuring expectations regarding aging. Design and Methods: In 1999, surveys containing the ERA-38 were mailed to 588 adults aged ≥ 65 years who were recruited through physicians; 429 individuals (73\%) returned completed surveys. The mean age of participants was 77 years; 76\% were White. In 2001, we surveyed 643 adults aged ≥ 65 years recruited at 14 senior centers. The mean age of participants was 78 years; 37\% were Latino and 16\% were African American. With the 1999 data, we selected items for the shorter version of the ERA-38 by using qualitative criteria and by evaluating the items' factor structure, internal consistency reliability of scales, and correlations with age and self-reported measures of health. Then, using the 2001 data, we evaluated the selected items with confirmatory factor analysis, and we reevaluated the internal consistency reliability and associations of the scales with age and self-reported measures of health. Results: The factor analyses of the ERA-12 on both samples provided support for three 4-item scales (expectations regarding physical health, expectations regarding mental health, and expectations regarding cognitive function), and one global expectations regarding aging scale combining all 12 items. In both samples, internal consistency reliability estimates for all scales exceeded 0.74, and the 12 items together explained over 88\% of the variance in the ERA-38 total score. We found comparable associations of the ERA-12 scales with age and self-reported health measures in both samples. Implications: The ERA-1 2 demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity to estimate expectations regarding aging. Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America.},

The findings show general and a model of four aging anxieties predicted significantly greater global disturbed eating with medium and large effects sizes respectively.

Having described the essence of SEM in the context of causal analysis, the author discusses the years of the development of structural modeling as the consequence of many researchers’ systematically growing needs (in particular in the social sciences) who strove to effectively understand the structure and interactions of latent phenomena. The early beginnings of SEM models were related to the work of Spearman and Wright, and to that of other prominent researchers who contributed to SEM development. The importance and predominance of theoretical assumptions over technical issues for the successful construction of SEM models are also described. Then, controversies regarding the use of SEM in the social sciences are presented. Finally, the opportunities and threats of this type of analytical strategy as well as selected areas of SEM applications in the social sciences are discussed.},

Unfortunately, most previous work on the RMSEA and its confidence interval has focused on models with a large df. Building on the work of Chen et al. to examine the impact of small df on the RMSEA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation using correctly specified models with varying df and sample size. The results of our investigation indicate that when the cutoff values are used to assess the fit of the properly specified models with small df and small sample size, the RMSEA too often falsely indicates a poor fitting model. We recommend not computing the RMSEA for small df models, especially those with small sample sizes, but rather estimating parameters that were not originally specified in the model.},

When the data are missing at random (MAR), standard errors based on expected information are not consistent, and observed information should be used.

	abstract = {A family of scaling con'ections aimed to improve the chi-square approximation of goodness-of-fit test statistics in small samples, large models, aM nonnormal data was proposed in Saton'a and Bentler (1994). For structural equations models, Satorra-Bentler's (SB) scaling con'ections are available in standard computer software. Often, however, the interest is not on the overall fit of a model, but on a test of the restrictions that a null model say Ad O implies on a less restricted one Adl. If To and T 1 denote the goodness-of-fit test statistics associated to AdO and Adl, respectively, then typically the difference Td = To-T1 is used as a chi-square test statistic with degrees of freedom equal to the difference on the number of independent parameters estimated under the models AdO and Adl. As in the case of the goodness-of-fit test, it is of interest to scale the statistic T d in order to improve its chi-squaxe approximation in realistic, that is, nonasymptotic and nonnormal, applications. In a recent paper, Satorra (2000) shows that the difference between two SB scaled test statistics for overall model fit does not yield the correct SB scaled difference test statistic. Satorra developed an expression that permits scaling the difference test statistic, but his formula has some practical limitations, since it requires heavy computations that are not available in standard computer software. The purpose of the present paper is to provide an easy way to compute the scaled difference chi-square statistic t{\textasciitilde}om the scaled goodness-of-fit test statistics of models Ado and Adl.

This would result in an increase in the interaction between medical professionals and older adults. In anticipation of an increased exposure to elderly patients, we sought to determine the attitudes of our house officers (HO), medical officers (MO) and Registrars towards the elderly. Materials and Methods: A descriptive pilot study of junior doctors from the Division of Medicine carried out during a luncheon in the largest tertiary-care public hospital in Singapore. A validated self-administered structured questionnaire using Kogan's Old People (KOP) Scale was used to evaluate attitudes towards older adults and basic demographics and medical educational data were collected. Results: Fifty-one questionnaires were completed. The mean KOP score was 114.4, suggesting an overall positive attitude towards older people in this sample. The prevalence of negative attitude was 7.8\%. There was no significant difference in attitudes among doctors with different designation, age, marital status, medical school attended, nationality, years in medical practice and living arrangement. Doctors who had previous exposure with a posting in Geriatric Medicine had higher KOP scores but were just out of significance (P= 0.098). Respondents who found treating older people unrewarding had significantly lower KOP score (P{\textgreater}0.001). Conclusion: In this sample of junior doctors, overall attitudes towards older people as measured by the KOP scale were moderately positive. Exposure to a Geriatric Medicine posting during residency may positively influence a doctor's attitudes towards the older adults.},

Demographic changes resulting in increasing numbers of elderly people and increased cancer incidence with age make it imperative to understand oncology healthcare professionals' attitudes towards older people. Design: A descriptive survey design was conducted, within a regional Cancer Centre, to evaluate oncology healthcare professionals' attitudes towards elderly people. The measurement scale used was Kogan's Old People Scale. Results: Regardless of gender, profession and clinical experience persistently negative attitudes were displayed towards elderly people. No statistically significant difference was detected between gender, profession, clinical experience or specialist education and although small in number, no large differences in scores were notable between group means. Conclusions: If oncology healthcare professionals are to provide optimal treatment and care for elderly people, negative attitudes must be addressed. These results indicate the need for a radical cultural shift in attitudes, especially when considered in conjunction with changing demographics and increased cancer incidence with age.},

This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb.

The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the associations between adherence to six a priori defined diet quality indices (including AHEI-2010, aMED, DASH, and three low-carbohydrate indices) throughout the first 3 years of observation and all-cause and cancer-specific mortalities in 468 newly diagnosed HNSCC patients from the University of Michigan Head and Neck Specialized Program of Research Excellence (UM-SPORE). The dietary intake data were measured using a food frequency questionnaire administered at three annual time points commencing at study entry. Deaths and their causes were documented throughout the study using various data sources. Marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the role of diet quality, as a time-varying covariate, on mortality. There were 93 deaths from all causes and 74 cancer-related deaths adjudicated throughout the observation period. There was a strong inverse association between adherence to the AHEI-2010, all-cause mortality (HR Q5-Q1 :0.07, 95\% CI:0.01-0.43, p trend:0.04), and cancer-specific mortality (HR Q5-Q1 :0.15, 95\% CI:0.02-1.07, p trend:0.04). Other more modest associations were noted for the low-carbohydrate indices. In sum, higher adherence to the AHEI-2010 and a plant-based low-carbohydrate index throughout the first 3 years since diagnosis may bolster survival and prognosis in newly diagnosed patients with HNSCC.},

            Rapid advances in sequencing technology have changed the experimental landscape of microbial ecology. In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the onset of schizophrenia and the physical complications after its onset are related to diet. Diet has been considered as a variable factor of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, the results of studies on this relationship have been inconsistent. Nutrients are consumed as a mixture in the diet. It is difficult to study them in isolation because they may have mutually complementary effects. The aim of this study was to assess the association between dietary patterns and schizophrenia in Japan.
METHODS: The subjects comprised 237 outpatients aged 30-60 years (123 males and 114 females) with diagnoses of either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The patient diagnoses were determined based on medical records. Patients were recruited between June 2011 and August 2011. As a reference group, 404 healthy volunteers aged 30-60 years (158 males and 246 females) were also included. Demographic data (age, sex, and level of education) were collected by face-to-face method interviews and self-administered questionnaires. We assessed eating habits over the last month using a validated brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. We detected dietary patterns through a principal component analysis of calorie-adjusted intake; two principal components were retained. The principal components for each dietary pattern and for each individual were divided into tertiles by principal component scores.
RESULTS: We derived two dietary patterns by principal component analysis; namely, the "vegetable" dietary pattern and the "cereal" dietary pattern. In the "cereal" dietary pattern, the high tertile was associated with a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia (P{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSION: The "cereal" dietary pattern is associated with schizophrenia. This article is the first to describe a study examining the association of dietary pattern and schizophrenia.},

DESIGN: Stimulated saliva samples from 292 participants with low levels of dental caries and periodontitis, enrolled in the Danish Health Examination Survey (DANHES), were analyzed for the presence of approximately 300 bacterial species by means of the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). Using presence and levels (mean HOMIM-value) of bacterial probes as endpoints, the influence of diet intake, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status on the bacterial saliva profile was analyzed by Mann-Whitney tests with Benjamini-Hochberg's correction for multiple comparisons and principal component analysis.
RESULTS: Targets for 131 different probes were identified in 292 samples, with Streptococcus and Veillonella being the most predominant genera identified. Two bacterial taxa (Streptococcus sobrinus and Eubacterium [11][G-3] brachy) were more associated with smokers than non-smokers (adjusted p-value{\textless}0.01). Stratification of the group based on extreme ends of the parameters age, gender, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), and diet intake had no statistical influence on the composition of the bacterial profile of saliva. Conversely, differences in socioeconomic status were reflected by the bacterial profiles of saliva.
CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial profile of saliva seems independent of diet intake, but influenced by smoking and maybe socioeconomic status.},

	abstract = {Data were collected on the prevalence of salmonella at different stages during the life cycle of 18 broiler flocks on different farms as well as during slaughter in different poultry slaughterhouses. For the isolation of salmonella, the highest sensitivity (93.9\%) was obtained by enrichment in the semi-solid agar Diasalm. The ‘overshoe method’ utilizing several pairs of overshoes provided the highest sensitivity for determining the salmonella status of the broilers during rearing. A clear decrease of the relative importance of the first production stages was demonstrated for the salmonella contamination of the end product, whereas horizontal transmission of salmonella to broilers during rearing and to broiler carcasses in the slaughterhouse was shown to be the main determinative factor. Ten of the 18 flocks received a salmonella positive status with the highest shedding occurring during the first 2 weeks of rearing. The shedding of the animals was significantly negatively influenced by the use of subtherapeutic or therapeutic doses of antibiotics. The intake of portable material in the broiler house was identified as the most important risk factor for horizontal transmission. Significant associations were found between the contamination level of a flock and hygiene of the broiler house, feed and water in the broiler house and both animal and non-animal material sampled in the environment. No correlation was found between contamination during the rearing period and contamination found after slaughtering. The presence of faecal material in the transport crates and predominantly the identity of the slaughterhouse seemed to be the determining factors for carcass quality. Improved hygiene management during transport of broilers and in some slaughterhouses could significantly reduce the risk of salmonella contamination of poultry meat.},

The persistence of these original "colonists" in their respective ecologic niches will depend in part on the accessibility of endogenous nutrients variously provided by saliva, tissue exudates, crevicular fluids, or degenerating host cells. It will also depend on their response to and interaction with microorganisms which immigrate to that site subsequently. The microbial ecology of a given site is therefore rarely uncomplicated, the notable exception occurring at the most microscopic level where one may encounter microcolonies of individual species within more heterogenous populations of microorganisms. The extent of this heterogeneity quantitatively and qualitatively is a reflection of the degree to which the interactions between the resident flora and the new arrivals, plus the local environmental changes which they both generate, serve to promote or to discourage the survival and growth of the individual species. This element of heterogeneity in a dynamic system with its inherent potential for variation makes it possible for relatively minor changes in local environmental conditions to result in significant differences in the microflora between one site and another even though they may be in close proximity to each other. Once this concept is appreciated it becomes easy to understand how disease processes such as dental caries may affect specific areas of a tooth while nearby areas are unaffected. The effects of exogenous nutrients on the ecology of the oral microbiota, nevertheless cannot be ignored. The diet may modulate such endogenous factors as the salivary secretions and the local resistance of the gingival tissues to infections. Although at our present state of knowledge the direct influence of dietary proteins and fats on the oral microbiota is thought to be of relatively minor consequence, dietary carbohydrates are of major ecological significance. Dietary sugars provide readily available substrates for the oral microorganisms, most of which depend on carbohydrates for energy sources. The metabolism of dietary sucrose by S. sanguis and S. mutans with the productions of acids and intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides has specific influence on the microbial composition, metabolic activities, and mass of coronal plaque. The ready availability of dietary carbohydrates undoubtedly influences the microflora of other parts of the oral cavity as well, eic species or indirectly through the interactions of other organisms with them...},

	abstract = {Six adults were served accurately weighed portions (about 5 g) of cookies varying in sucrose and fat content. The cookies were chewed and spat out at the time the subjects were ready to swallow. Additional spittings were collected at intervals up to two, three, and four min. Chewing time decreased with increase in sucrose, or with increase in fat. The volume of saliva in each spitting was calculated from its wet and dry weights, and it was assumed either (a) that saliva produced during chewing was not carried over in the retained food, or (b) that saliva was incorporated in the retained food in the same proportion as in the first spitting. Both approaches revealed that salivary flow rates were independent of cookie formulation, with two exceptions: (1) The cookie highest in sucrose produced a significantly higher flow rate during chewing, and (2) the fat-free cookie, which was hard to chew, elicited an elevated flow rate up to two min. The total volume of saliva for the entire experimental period was similar for all formulations, except the latter. Masticatory effects, therefore, appeared to predominate over sweetness stimulation, unless sugar content was very high. The volume of saliva in the food bolus at the time of swallowing correlated with chewing time. Oral clearance of the cookies did not give straight lines when logarithms of retained material were plotted against time. Initial clearance rates appeared to diminish with increasing sucrose and fat content of the cookies. Effects of sugar and fat on all parameters may reflect changes in cookie texture and the sizes of particles produced within the mouth.},

	abstract = {Despite advancement in cancer treatment, oral cancer has a poor prognosis and is often detected at late stage. To overcome these challenges, investigators should search for early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. More than 700 bacterial species reside in the oral cavity. The oral microbiome population varies by saliva and different habitats of oral cavity. Tobacco, alcohol, and betel nut, which are causative factors of oral cancer, may alter the oral microbiome composition. Both pathogenic and commensal strains of bacteria have significantly contributed to oral cancer. Numerous bacterial species in the oral cavity are involved in chronic inflammation that lead to development of oral carcinogenesis. Bacterial products and its metabolic by-products may induce permanent genetic alterations in epithelial cells of the host that drive proliferation and/or survival of epithelial cells. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum induce production of inflammatory cytokines, cell proliferation, and inhibition of apoptosis, cellular invasion, and migration thorough host cell genomic alterations. Recent advancement in metagenomic technologies may be useful in identifying oral cancer–related microbiome, their genomes, virulence properties, and their interaction with host immunity. It is very important to address which bacterial species is responsible for driving oral carcinogenesis. Alteration in the oral commensal microbial communities have potential application as a diagnostic tool to predict oral squamous cell carcinoma. Clinicians should be aware that the protective properties of the resident microflora are beneficial to define treatment strategies. To develop highly precise and effective therapeutic approaches, identification of specific oral microbiomes may be required. In this review, we narrate the role of microbiome in the progression of oral cancer and its role as an early diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for oral cancer.},

We confirm earlier reports that the relative abundances of Lactobacillus spp. and Neisseria spp. are elevated and diminished, respectively, in human HNSCC. In parallel, we examined the disease-modifying effects of microbiota in HNSCC, through both antibiotic depletion of microbiota in an induced HNSCC mouse model (4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide, 4NQO) and reconstitution of tumor-associated microbiota in a germ-free orthotopic mouse model. We demonstrate that depletion of microbiota delays oral tumorigenesis, while microbiota transfer from mice with oral cancer accelerates tumorigenesis. Enrichment of Lactobacillus spp. was also observed in murine HNSCC, and activation of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor was documented in both murine and human tumors. Together, our findings support the hypothesis that dysbiosis promotes HNSCC development.},

We used a 16S rRNA V3-V5 marker gene approach to compare the saliva microbiome in DNA isolated from Oropharyngeal (OPSCC), Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) patients and normal epithelium controls, to characterize the HNSCC saliva microbiota and examine their abundance before and after surgical resection.The analyses identified a predominance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, with less frequent presence of Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria before surgery. At lower taxonomic levels, the most abundant genera were Streptococcus, Prevotella, Haemophilus, Lactobacillus and Veillonella, with lower numbers of Citrobacter and Neisseraceae genus Kingella. HNSCC patients had a significant loss in richness and diversity of microbiota species (p{\textless}0.05) compared to the controls. Overall, the Operational Taxonomic Units network shows that the relative abundance of OTU's within genus Streptococcus, Dialister, and Veillonella can be used to discriminate tumor from control samples (p{\textless}0.05). Tumor samples lost Neisseria, Aggregatibacter (Proteobacteria), Haemophillus (Firmicutes) and Leptotrichia (Fusobacteria). Paired taxa within family Enterobacteriaceae, together with genus Oribacterium, distinguish OCSCC samples from OPSCC and normal samples (p{\textless}0.05). Similarly, only HPV positive samples have an abundance of genus Gemellaceae and Leuconostoc (p{\textless}0.05). Longitudinal analyses of samples taken before and after surgery, revealed a reduction in the alpha diversity measure after surgery, together with an increase of this measure in patients that recurred (p{\textless}0.05).

	abstract = {The human oral cavity contains a number of different habitats, including the teeth, gingival sulcus, tongue, cheeks, hard and soft palates, and tonsils, which are colonized by bacteria. The oral microbiome is comprised of over 600 prevalent taxa at the species level, with distinct subsets predominating at different habitats. The oral microbiome has been extensively characterized by cultivation and culture-independent molecular methods such as 16S rRNA cloning. Unfortunately, the vast majority of unnamed oral taxa are referenced by clone numbers or 16S rRNA GenBank accession numbers, often without taxonomic anchors. The first aim of this research was to collect 16S rRNA gene sequences into a curated phylogeny-based database, the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), and make it web accessible (www.homd.org). The HOMD includes 619 taxa in 13 phyla, as follows: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, SR1, Synergistetes, Tenericutes, and TM7. The second aim was to analyze 36,043 16S rRNA gene clones isolated from studies of the oral microbiota to determine the relative abundance of taxa and identify novel candidate taxa. The analysis identified 1,179 taxa, of which 24\% were named, 8\% were cultivated but unnamed, and 68\% were uncultivated phylotypes. Upon validation, 434 novel, nonsingleton taxa will be added to the HOMD. The number of taxa needed to account for 90\%, 95\%, or 99\% of the clones examined is 259, 413, and 875, respectively. The HOMD is the first curated description of a human-associated microbiome and provides tools for use in understanding the role of the microbiome in health and disease.},

For example, the public discourse around older adults had a paternalistic tone framing all older adults as "vulnerable". This study aimed to measure the extent to which perceived age discrimination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the sense of loneliness and social isolation, fear and perception of COVID-19 risks, had a negative effect on older adults' mental illness. To do so, a self-report questionnaire was administered to 1301 participants (average age: 77.25 years old, SD = 5.46; 56.10\% females, 43.90\% males). Descriptive and correlational analyses were performed, along with structural equation modelling. Results showed that perceived age discrimination in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic positively predicts loneliness and also indirectly predicts mental illness. In addition, loneliness is the strongest predictor of mental illness together with fear of COVID-19 and social isolation. Such results highlight the importance of implementing public policies and discourses that are non-discriminating, and that favour the inclusion of older people.},

Therefore, 40 healthcare professionals (physicians and medical students) record a podcast where they have to explain an endocrine therapy to two fictional patients (40- vs. 70-year old). Results show that when participants explained the treatment to the older patient, they used shorter utterances and made more repetitions. They also evoked fewer side effects such as sexual issues. Moreover, reduction in length of utterances and of word-per-minute rate was observed for older patient when participants have a positive view of ageing but for both patients when they have a negative view of ageing. In conclusion, physicians and medical students used elderspeak when they explained a treatment to older patients. Participants with a more negative view of ageing also unconsciously talked slower and made shorter utterances to a 40 -year-old patient.},

Using a qualitative approach, the current study aimed to examine similarities and differences across healthcare disciplines. Three focus groups were conducted with physicians, nurses, and social workers. Data from each focus group were analyzed separately, and then commonalities and differences across the groups were evaluated. Three main themes relating to older adults emerged from the data. The first theme pertains to perceived difficulties that healthcare professionals experience in working with older adults and their family members; the second focuses on invisibility and discriminatory communication patterns; and the third theme relates to provision of inappropriate care to older adults. Similarities and differences across the three disciplines were found. The differences related mainly to the examples provided for manifestations of ageism in the healthcare system. Provision of inadequate treatment to older adults due to their age appeared to be the most complex theme, and is discussed at length in the Discussion. Briefly, the complexity stems from the fact that although some behaviors can be clearly described as inappropriate and undesirable, other behaviors such as avoidance of invasive medical procedures for older patients raise ethical dilemmas. Potentially, avoidance of invasive medical treatment can be perceived as compassionate care rather than as undertreatment due to ageist perceptions. A related dilemma, i.e., longevity versus quality-of-life, is also discussed in light of the finding that the balance of these two aspects changes as patients grow old.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, measured with the US Department of Agriculture Healthy Eating Index (HEI), was associated with only a small reduction in major chronic disease risk. Research suggests that greater reductions in risk are possible with more specific guidance.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether 2 alternate measures of diet quality, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the Recommended Food Score (RFS), would predict chronic disease risk reduction more effectively than did the HEI.
DESIGN: A total of 38 615 men from the Health Professional's Follow-up Study and 67 271 women from the Nurses' Health Study completed dietary questionnaires. Major chronic disease was defined as the initial occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, or nontraumatic death during 8-12 y of follow-up.
RESULTS: High AHEI scores were associated with significant reductions in risk of major chronic disease in men [multivariate relative risk (RR): 0.80; 95\% CI: 0.71, 0.91] and in women (RR: 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.82, 0.96) when comparing the highest and lowest quintiles. Reductions in risk were particularly strong for CVD in men (RR: 0.61; 95\% CI: 0.49, 0.75) and in women (RR: 0.72; 95\% CI: 0.60, 0.86). In men but not in women, the RFS predicted risk of major chronic disease (RR: 0.93; 95\% CI: 0.83, 1.04) and CVD (RR: 0.77; 95\% CI: 0.64, 0.93).
CONCLUSIONS: The AHEI predicted chronic disease risk better than did the RFS (or the HEI, in our previous research) primarily because of a strong inverse association with CVD. Dietary guidelines can be improved by providing more specific and comprehensive advice.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to assess the association between the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and risk of type 2 diabetes in women.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 80,029 women aged 38-63 years in the Nurses' Health Study were followed from 1984 to 2002. The AHEI score was computed from dietary information collected from five repeated food frequency questionnaires administered between 1984 and 1998. Relative risks (RRs) for type 2 diabetes were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known diabetes risk factors. We also examined how changes in score in 4, 6-8, and 10-12 years are associated with diabetes risk.
RESULTS: We ascertained 5,183 incident cases of type 2 diabetes during 18 years of follow-up. Women who scored high on the AHEI had a lower risk (RR comparing top to bottom score quintile 0.64 [95\% CI 0.58-0.71], P(trend) {\textless} 0.0001) for diabetes. Women with consistently high AHEI scores throughout follow-up, compared with those with consistently low scores, had the lowest risk for diabetes. In addition, women whose AHEI scores improved during follow-up, even during recent years, had a lower risk of diabetes than did women whose (low) score did not change.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher AHEI score is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in women. Therefore, the AHEI score may be a useful clinical tool to assess diet quality and to recommend for the prevention of diabetes.},

              Dietary indices have been related to risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) predominantly in white populations. The present study evaluated this association in the ethnically diverse Multiethnic Cohort and examined four diet quality indices in relation to T2D risk, homoeostatic model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and biomarkers of dyslipidaemia, inflammation and adipokines. The T2D analysis included 166 550 white, African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American and Latino participants (9200 incident T2D cases). Dietary intake was assessed at baseline using a quantitative FFQ and T2D status was based on three self-reports and confirmed by administrative data. Biomarkers were assessed about 10 years later in a biomarker subcohort (
              n
              10 060). Sex- and ethnicity-specific hazard ratios were calculated for the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010), the alternative HEI-2010 (AHEI-2010), the alternate Mediterranean diet score (aMED) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). Multivariable-adjusted means of biomarkers were compared across dietary index tertiles in the biomarker subcohort. The AHEI-2010, aMED (in men only) and DASH scores were related to a 10–20 \% lower T2D risk, with the strongest associations in whites and the direction of the relationships mostly consistent across ethnic groups. Higher scores on the four indices were related to lower HOMA-IR, TAG and C-reactive protein concentrations, not related to leptin, and the DASH score was directly associated with adiponectin. The AHEI-2010 and DASH were directly related to HDL-cholesterol in women. Potential underlying biological mechanisms linking diet quality and T2D risk are an improved lipid profile and reduced systemic inflammation and, with regards to DASH alone, an improved adiponectin profile.},

              Background
              Nutritional epidemiology research using self-reported dietary intake is prone to measurement error. Objective methods are being explored to overcome this limitation.
            
            
              Objectives
              We aimed to examine 1) the association between plasma markers related to inflammation and derive marker scores for dietary patterns [Mediterranean dietary score (MDS), energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DIITM), Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI)] and 2) the associations of these marker scores with mortality.
            
            
              Methods
              Weighted marker scores were derived from the cross-sectional association between 30 plasma markers and each dietary score (assessed using food-frequency questionnaires) using linear regression for 770 participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (aged 50–82 y). Prospective associations between marker scores and mortality (n = 249 deaths) were assessed using Cox regression (median follow-up: 14.4 y).
            
            
              Results
              The MDS, E-DII, and AHEI were associated (P \&lt; 0.05) with 9, 14, and 11 plasma markers, respectively. Healthier diets (higher MDS and AHEI, and lower anti-inflammatory, E-DII) were associated with lower concentrations of kynurenines, neopterin, IFN-γ, cytokines, and C-reactive protein. Five of 6 markers common to the 3 dietary scores were components of the kynurenine pathway. The 3 dietary-based marker scores were highly correlated (Spearman ρ: –0.74, –0.82, and 0.93). Inverse associations (for 1-SD increment) were observed with all-cause mortality for the MDS marker score (HR: 0.84; 95\% CI: 0.72–0.98) and the AHEI marker score (HR: 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.66–0.89), whereas a positive association was observed with the E-DII marker score (HR: 1.18; 95\% CI: 1.01–1.39). The same magnitude of effect was not observed for the respective dietary patterns.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Markers involved in inflammation-related processes are associated with dietary quality, including a substantial overlap between markers associated with the MDS, the E-DII, and the AHEI, especially kynurenines. Unfavorable marker scores, reflecting poorer-quality diets, were associated with increased mortality.},

Prudent dietary patterns have been associated with disease prevention, yet little evidence exists describing diet quality (DQ) in older overweight or obese African American (AA) adults with OA and its relation to body composition. We conducted a secondary data analysis of a dataset containing alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), body composition, OA severity, and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) data from 126 AA females (aged 60–87 years) with OA to examine the relationships between these variables. Our sample had poor DQ and reported having higher OA severity as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Interleukin-6 was negatively correlated with AHEI-2010, and AHEI-2010 and the WOMAC physical function subcategory (WOMACpf) were significant predictors of IL-6 (odds ratio (OR): 0.95, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.92–0.99 and 1.04, 95\% CI 1.01–1.07, respectively, p {\textless} 0.05) but not body composition.

	abstract = {The promoter region of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene has a putative NF-kappa B-binding site. We found that a fragment of the IL-6 promoter containing the site specifically binds highly purified NF-kappa B protein and the NF-kappa B protein in nuclear extracts of phorbol ester-induced Jurkat cells. Mutations of the NF-kappa B site abolished complex formation with both purified NF-kappa B and the nuclear extract protein. Transient expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmids containing the IL-6 promoter revealed very little activity of the promoter in U-937 monocytic cells and in HeLa cells before stimulation. However, stimulation of U-937 and HeLa cells by inducers of NF-kappa B led to a dramatic increase in CAT activity. Mutations in the NF-kappa B-binding site abolished inducibility of IL-6 promoter-cat constructs in U-937 cells by lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, the double-stranded RNA poly(IC), or phytohemagglutinin and in HeLa cells by tumor necrosis factor alpha and drastically reduced but did not completely eliminate inducibility in HeLa cells stimulated by double-stranded RNA poly(IC) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These results suggest that NF-kappa B is an important mediator for activation of the IL-6 gene by a variety of IL-6 inducers in both U-937 and HeLa cells and that alternative inducible enhancer elements contribute in a cell-specific manner to IL-6 gene induction. Because NF-kappa B is involved in the control of a variety of genes activated upon inflammation, NF-kappa B may play a central role in the inflammatory response to infection and tissue injury.},

Despite significant advances in treatment modalities, the five-year survival rate in patients with HNSCC has improved marginally and therefore warrants a comprehensive understanding of the HNSCC biology. Alterations in the cellular and non-cellular components of the HNSCC tumor micro-environment (TME) play a critical role in regulating many hallmarks of cancer development including evasion of apoptosis, activation of invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, response to therapy, immune escape mechanisms, deregulation of energetics, and therefore the development of an overall aggressive HNSCC phenotype. Cytokines and chemokines are small secretory proteins produced by neoplastic or stromal cells, controlling complex and dynamic cell–cell interactions in the TME to regulate many cancer hallmarks. This review summarizes the current understanding of the complex cytokine/chemokine networks in the HNSCC TME, their role in activating diverse signaling pathways and promoting tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance development.},

However, the mechanism of action and the components involved in this effect have not been identified clearly. In recent years, the scientific community has agreed to focus its attention on a class of secondary metabolites extensively present in a wide range of plant foods: the flavonoids, suggested as having different biological roles. The anti-inflammatory actions of flavonoids
              in vitro
              or in cellular models involve the inhibition of the synthesis and activities of different pro-inflammatory mediators such as eicosanoids, cytokines, adhesion molecules and C-reactive protein. Molecular activities of flavonoids include inhibition of transcription factors such as NF-κB and activating protein-1 (AP-1), as well as activation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). However, the
              in vitro
              evidence might be somehow of limited impact due to the non-physiological concentrations utilized and to the fact that
              in vivo
              flavonoids are extensively metabolized to molecules with different chemical structures and activities compared with the ones originally present in the food. Human studies investigating the effect of flavonoids on markers of inflammation are insufficient, and are mainly focused on flavonoid-rich foods but not on pure molecules. Most of the studies lack assessment of flavonoid absorption or fail to associate an effect on inflammation with a change in circulating levels of flavonoids. Human trials with appropriate placebo and pure flavonoid molecules are needed to clarify if flavonoids represent ancillary ingredients or key molecules involved in the anti-inflammatory properties of plant foods.},

	abstract = {Tumor hypoxia is described as an oxygen deprivation in malignant tissue. The hypoxic condition is a consequence of an imbalance between rapidly proliferating cells and a vascularization that leads to lower oxygen levels in tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is an essential transcription factor contributing to the regulation of hypoxia-associated genes. Some of these genes modulate molecular cascades associated with the Warburg effect and its accompanying pathways and, therefore, represent promising targets for cancer treatment. Current progress in the development of therapeutic approaches brings several promising inhibitors of HIF-1. Flavonoids, widely occurring in various plants, exert a broad spectrum of beneficial effects on human health, and are potentially powerful therapeutic tools against cancer. Recent evidences identified numerous natural flavonoids and their derivatives as inhibitors of HIF-1, associated with the regulation of critical glycolytic components in cancer cells, including pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), glucose transporters (GLUTs), hexokinase II (HKII), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Here, we discuss the results of most recent studies evaluating the impact of flavonoids on HIF-1 accompanied by the regulation of critical enzymes contributing to the Warburg phenotype. Besides, flavonoid effects on glucose metabolism via regulation of HIF-1 activity represent a promising avenue in cancer-related research. At the same time, only more-in depth investigations can further elucidate the mechanistic and clinical connections between HIF-1 and cancer metabolism.},

Such distinct sets of cytokines from the tumor microenvironment can be detected in the circulation and are thus potentially useful as biomarkers to detect cancers, predict disease outcomes and manage therapeutic choices. Indeed, analyses of circulating cytokines in combination with cancer-specific biomarkers have been proposed to simplify and improve cancer detection and prognosis, especially from minimally-invasive liquid biopsies, such as blood. Additionally, the cytokine signaling signatures of the peripheral immune cells, even from patients with localized tumors, are recently found altered in cancer, and may also prove applicable as cancer biomarkers. Here we review cytokines induced by the tumor microenvironment, their roles in various stages of cancer development, and their potential use in diagnostics and prognostics. We further discuss the established and emerging diagnostic approaches that can be used to detect cancers from liquid biopsies, and additionally the technological advancement required for their use in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {HNSCCs are the major progressive malignancy of the upper digestive and respiratory organs. Malignant phenotypes of HNSCCs are regulated by the pro- and anti-tumoral activities of the immune modulatory cytokines associated with TMEs, i.e., a representative pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, plays a role as an anti-tumor regulator against HNSCCs; however, IFN-γ also drives programmed death-ligand (PD-L) 1 expression to promote cancer stem cells. Interleukin (IL)-2 promotes the cytotoxic activity of T cells and natural killer cells; however, endogenous IL-2 can promote regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in the protection of HNSCCs. In this report, we first classified and mentioned the immune modulatory aspects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines upon HNSCC phenotypes. In the TME of HNSCCs, pro-tumoral immune modulation is mediated by stromal cells, including CAFs, MDSCs, pDCs, and TAMs. Therefore, we evaluated the functions of cytokines and chemokines that mediate the crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells. In HNSCCs, the status of lymph node metastasis is an important hallmark of a worse prognosis. We therefore evaluated the possibility of chemokines mediating lymph node metastases in HNSCC patients. We also mention therapeutic approaches using anti-tumoral cytokines or immunotherapies that target cytokines, chemokines, or signal molecules essential for the immune evasion of HNSCCs. We finally discuss modulation by HPV infection upon HNSCC phenotypes, as well as the prognostic significance of serum cytokine levels in HNSCC patients.},

	abstract = {Altered immune, inflammatory, and angiogenesis responses are observed in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and many of these responses have been linked with aggressive malignant behavior and a decrease in prognosis. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that HNSCC cells produce cytokines that regulate immune, inflammatory, and angiogenesis responses. We identified important regulatory cytokines in supernatants of well-defined and freshly cultured HNSCC cell lines by ELISA and determined whether these cytokines are detected in tumor cell lines and tissue specimens by immunohistochemistry. The serum concentration of the cytokines and cytokine-dependent acute phase inflammatory responses (i.e., fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) from patients with HNSCC was determined, and the potential relationship of serum cytokine levels to tumor volume was analyzed. Cytokines interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor were detected in similar concentration ranges in the supernatants of a panel of established University of Michigan squamous cell carcinoma (UM-SCC) cell lines and supernatants of freshly isolated primary HNSCC cultures. Evidence for the expression of IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and VEGF in HNSCC cells within tumor specimens in situ was obtained by immunohistochemistry. In a prospective comparison of the cytokine level and cytokine-inducible acute-phase proteins in serum, we report that cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF were detected at higher concentrations in the serum of patients with HNSCC compared with patients with laryngeal papilloma or age-matched control subjects (at P {\textless} 0.05). The serum concentrations of IL-8 and VEGF were found to be weakly correlated with large primary tumor volume (R2 = 0.2 and 0.4, respectively). Elevated IL-1- and IL-6-inducible acute-phase responses were also detected in cancer patients but not in patients with papilloma or control subjects (at P {\textless} 0.05). We therefore conclude that cytokines important in proinflammatory and proangiogenic responses are detectable in cell lines, tissue specimens, and serum from patients with HNSCC. These cytokines may increase the pathogenicity of HNSCC and prove useful as biomarkers or targets for therapy.},

Because some of the suppressed immune parameters were shown to be of prognostic importance in trauma and sepsis, we investigated whether these would also correlate with survival in head and neck cancer.
METHODS: Severely malnourished head and neck cancer patients undergoing ablative and reconstructive surgery were followed prospectively and their perioperative immune parameters were related to long-term survival.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with a preoperative weight loss of more than 10\% were followed up for a period of at least 16 months after surgery. Analyses of variance revealed that preoperative human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on monocytes and endotoxin-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were different between patients who survived and patients who died. Proportional hazards identified a weight loss of more than 12\%, the presence of coexistent disease, and an HLA-DR expression on monocytes below the cutoff points (mean fluorescence index {\textless} 15, peak channel index {\textless} 9) to be of significant influence on survival.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to known prognostic parameters such as tumor stage, coexistent disease, and weight loss, the immune parameters HLA-DR expression on monocytes and endotoxin-induced cytokine production may carry prognostic value in cancer patients. Immunomodulating therapies leading to improvement of these parameters might in the future lead to increased options for treatment.},

Patients with stage III-IVB head and neck cancer received cisplatin, docetaxel, and cetuximab (TPE) followed by radiotherapy, cisplatin, and cetuximab (XPE) and maintenance cetuximab in a phase II clinical trial. Serum and tissue biomarkers were examined for treatment-related changes and for association with clinical outcomes. Concentrations of 31 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were measured before and after 3 cycles (9 weeks) of induction TPE using multi-analyte immunobead-based profiling (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX), with selected analytes validated by a single analyte enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tumor biomarkers included phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (pSTAT3), EGFR and human papillomavirus (HPV). Thirty-one patients had baseline biomarkers and 25 had paired samples, pre- and post-TPE. Adjusting for false discovery, 14 analytes including MCP1c, IP-10, Leptin, interleukin (IL)-5, Eotaxin, IL-6, G-CSF, CXCL5 changed significantly post TPE induction. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-6 levels were associated with tumor response as assessed by positron emission tomography and progression-free survival, however, the association was not significant after adjustment for false discovery. Analytes were not associated with toxicities, smoking history, HPV status, EGFR amplification, or pSTAT3 tumor protein levels. Baseline serum biomarkers, in particular VEGF and IL-6, were identified as potentially useful prognostic markers of cetuximab-containing therapy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased pretreatment serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels among patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis, but sample sizes in prior studies have been small and thus unable to control for other known prognostic variables.
METHODS: A longitudinal, prospective cohort study determined the correlation between pretreatment serum IL-6 levels, and tumor recurrence and all-cause survival in a large population (N = 444) of previously untreated HNSCC patients. Control variables included age, sex, smoking, cancer site and stage, and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier plots and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association between IL-6 levels, control variables, and time to recurrence and survival.
RESULTS: The median serum IL-6 level was 13 pg/mL (range, 0-453). The 2-year recurrence rate was 35.2\% (standard error, 2.67\%). The 2-year death rate was 26.5\% (standard error, 2.26\%). Multivariate analyses showed that serum IL-6 levels independently predicted recurrence at significant levels [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.11 to 1.58; P = .002] as did cancer site (oral/sinus). Serum IL-6 level was also a significant independent predictor of poor survival (HR = 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.46; P = .03), as were older age, smoking, cancer site (oral/sinus), higher cancer stage, and comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment serum IL-6 could be a valuable biomarker for predicting recurrence and overall survival among HNSCC patients. Using IL-6 as a biomarker for recurrence and survival may allow for earlier identification and treatment of disease relapse.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cytokines and growth factors modulated by transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB and secreted by tumor and stromal cells are detectable in serum of patients with advanced cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Longitudinal changes in these serum factors could be early biomarkers of treatment response and survival.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, growth-related oncogene-1 (GRO-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) concentrations were determined by Luminex multiplex assay using serum obtained at baseline and every 3 months in a prospective study of 30 patients with locally advanced (stage III/IV) oropharyngeal SCC receiving chemoradiation therapy. The relationship between baseline and direction of change in individual and multiple cytokines with cause-specific and disease-free survival was determined by Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Statistical analyses included adjustment for smoking status and response to chemoradiation.
RESULTS: Three-year cause-specific and disease-free survival was 74.4\% and 68.9\%. Nonsmoking history (P = 0.05) and higher baseline VEGF (P = 0.003) correlated with increased survival. Longitudinal increases in levels of individual factors predicted decreased cause-specific survival when adjusted for smoking history [IL-6: relative risk (RR), 3.8; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 2.0-7.4; P = 0.004; IL-8: RR, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.2; P = 0.05; VEGF: RR, 3.0; 95\% CI, 1.6-5.6; P = 0.01; HGF: RR, 2.9; 95\% CI, 1.9-4.4; P = 0.02; and GRO-1: RR, 1.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.3; P = 0.02]. For a given individual, large increases in the upper quartile for any three or more factors predicted poorer cause-specific survival compared with patients with two or fewer large increases in factor levels (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment VEGF levels and longitudinal change in IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, HGF, and GRO-1 may be useful as biomarkers for response and survival in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal and head and neck SCC treated with chemoradiation.},

	abstract = {This review includes an historical overview of the techniques for measuring energy expenditure (EE). Following this overview, the "gold standard" method of measuring EE, the doubly labelled water (DLW) method, is emphasised. Other methods, such as direct calorimetry, indirect calorimetry systems, heart rate and EE relationships, questionnaires and activity recall, motion sensors, combined heart rate and motion sensors for the estimation of EE are then highlighted in relation to their validation against the DLW method. The major advantages and disadvantages for each method are then considered. The preferred method to determine EE is likely to depend principally on factors such as the number of study participants to be monitored, the time period of measurements and the finances available. Small study participant numbers over a short period may be measured accurately by means of indirect calorimetric methods (stationary and portable systems). For periods over 3-4 days, EE should ideally be measured using the DLW method. However, the use of motion sensors is very promising in the measurement of EE, and has a number of advantages over the DLW method. Furthermore, if used correctly, both heart rate and questionnaire methods may provide valuable estimates of EE. Additional studies are needed to examine the possibility of improving the accuracy of measurement by combining two or more techniques. Such information, if confirmed by scientific rigour, may lead to an improvement in the estimation of EE and population-based physical activity levels. The accurate measurement of physical activity and EE is critical from both a research and health prospective. A consideration of the relevant techniques used for the estimation of EE may also help improve the quality of these frequently reported measurements.},

              Objectives
              To review current practice in the analysis and reporting of epidemiological research and to identify limitations.
            
            
              Design
              Examination of articles published in January 2001 that investigated associations between risk factors/exposure variables and disease events/measures in individuals.
            
            
              Setting
              Eligible English language journals including all major epidemiological journals, all major general medical journals, and the two leading journals in cardiovascular disease and cancer.
            
            
              Main outcome measure
              Each article was evaluated with a standard proforma.
            
            
              Results
              We found 73 articles in observational epidemiology; most were either cohort or case-control studies. Most studies looked at cancer and cardiovascular disease, even after we excluded specialty journals. Quantitative exposure variables predominated, which were mostly analysed as ordered categories but with little consistency or explanation regarding choice of categories. Sample selection, participant refusal, and data quality received insufficient attention in many articles. Statistical analyses commonly used odds ratios (38 articles) and hazard/rate ratios (23), with some inconsistent use of terminology. Confidence intervals were reported in most studies (68), though use of P values was less common (38). Few articles explained their choice of confounding variables; many performed subgroup analyses claiming an effect modifier, though interaction tests were rare. Several investigated multiple associations between exposure and outcome, increasing the likelihood of false positive claims. There was evidence of publication bias.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This survey raises concerns regarding inadequacies in the analysis and reporting of epidemiological publications in mainstream journals.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Reports of observational epidemiological studies often categorise (group) continuous risk factor (exposure) variables. However, there has been little systematic assessment of how categorisation is practiced or reported in the literature and no extended guidelines for the practice have been identified. Thus, we assessed the nature of such practice in the epidemiological literature. Two months (December 2007 and January 2008) of five epidemiological and five general medical journals were reviewed. All articles that examined the relationship between continuous risk factors and health outcomes were surveyed using a standard proforma, with the focus on the primary risk factor. Using the survey results we provide illustrative examples and, combined with ideas from the broader literature and from experience, we offer guidelines for good practice.
            
            
              Results
              Of the 254 articles reviewed, 58 were included in our survey. Categorisation occurred in 50 (86\%) of them. Of those, 42\% also analysed the variable continuously and 24\% considered alternative groupings. Most (78\%) used 3 to 5 groups. No articles relied solely on dichotomisation, although it did feature prominently in 3 articles. The choice of group boundaries varied: 34\% used quantiles, 18\% equally spaced categories, 12\% external criteria, 34\% other approaches and 2\% did not describe the approach used. Categorical risk estimates were most commonly (66\%) presented as pairwise comparisons to a reference group, usually the highest or lowest (79\%). Reporting of categorical analysis was mostly in tables; only 20\% in figures.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Categorical analyses of continuous risk factors are common. Accordingly, we provide recommendations for good practice. Key issues include pre-defining appropriate choice of groupings and analysis strategies, clear presentation of grouped findings in tables and figures, and drawing valid conclusions from categorical analyses, avoiding injudicious use of multiple alternative analyses.},

	abstract = {A case-control study of oral cancer was conducted in Beijing, People's Republic of China to examine the association between dietary nutrient intake and risk of oral cancer, both in terms of estimated intake of nutrients and micro-nutrients, and in terms of specific foods and food groups. The study was hospital-based and controls were hospital in-patients matched for age and sex with the cases. The response rate for cases and controls was 100\% and 404 case/control pairs were interviewed. The results suggest that increased protein and fat intake are related to a decreased risk of oral cancer. Carbohydrate intake, however, showed a moderate increased risk for oral cancer. Total carotene intake and carotene intake from fruits and vegetables are inversely associated with risk of oral cancer. A similar pattern was observed for dietary vitamin C intake. Dietary fibre derived from fruits and vegetables showed a strong negative association with oral cancer risk, but fibre derived from other sources did not exhibit any protective effect. At the level of foods and food groups, increased consumption of fresh meat, chicken and liver was significantly associated with a reduction in oral cancer risk: the tests for trend were all statistically significant at the P {\textless} 0.01 level. Consumption of common carp, hairtail, shrimp and lobster were also associated with decreased risk. Risk was found to increase with increasing consumption of millet and corn bread (P {\textless} 0.01) but to decrease with increasing consumption of rice (P {\textless} 0.01). Increased consumption of grapes, bananas, oranges, tangerines, peaches and pears were associated with reduced risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background:
              Fatty acids impact obesity, estrogens, and inflammation, which are risk factors for ovarian cancer. Few epidemiologic studies have investigated the association of fatty acids with ovarian cancer.
            
            
              Methods:
              Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), 1,486 incident ovarian cancer cases were identified. Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for ovarian cancer risk factors were used to estimate HRs of ovarian cancer across quintiles of intake of fatty acids. False discovery rate was computed to control for multiple testing. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs of ovarian cancer across tertiles of plasma fatty acids among 633 cases and two matched controls in a nested case–control analysis.
            
            
              Results:
              A positive association was found between ovarian cancer and intake of industrial trans elaidic acid [HR comparing fifth with first quintileQ5-Q1 = 1.29; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03–1.62; Ptrend = 0.02, q-value = 0.06]. Dietary intakes of n-6 linoleic acid (HRQ5-Q1 = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.01–1.21; Ptrend = 0.03) and n-3 α-linolenic acid (HRQ5-Q1 = 1.18; 95\% CI = 1.05–1.34; Ptrend = 0.007) from deep-frying fats were also positively associated with ovarian cancer. Suggestive associations were reported for circulating elaidic (OR comparing third with first tertileT3-T1 = 1.39; 95\% CI = 0.99–1.94; Ptrend = 0.06) and α-linolenic acids (ORT3-T1 = 1.30; 95\% CI = 0.98–1.72; Ptrend = 0.06).
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our results suggest that higher intakes and circulating levels of industrial trans elaidic acid, and higher intakes of linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid from deep-frying fat, may be associated with greater risk of ovarian cancer.
            
            
              Impact:
              If causal, eliminating industrial trans-fatty acids could offer a straightforward public health action for reducing ovarian cancer risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
              The high diabetes incidence among Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians cannot be explained by BMI. Therefore, we examined the influence of three dietary patterns of “fat and meat,” “vegetables,” and “fruit and milk” on diabetes risk in the Hawaii component of the Multiethnic Cohort with 29,759 Caucasians, 35,244 Japanese Americans, and 10,509 Native Hawaiians.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              Subjects aged 45–75 years completed a baseline food frequency questionnaire. After 14 years of follow-up, 8,587 subjects with incident diabetes were identified through self-reports or health plan linkages. Risk was assessed using Cox regression stratified by age and adjusted for ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, education, total energy, smoking, alcohol intake, marital status, and hypertension.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Fat and meat was significantly associated with diabetes risk in men (hazard ratio 1.40 [95\% CI 1.23–1.60], Ptrend \&lt; 0.0001) and women (1.22 [1.06–1.40], Ptrend = 0.004) when extreme quintiles were compared. Except in Hawaiian women, the magnitude of the risk was similar across ethnic groups although not always significant. After stratification by BMI, fat and meat remained a predictor of disease primarily among overweight men and among overweight Japanese women. Vegetables lowered diabetes risk in men (0.86 [0.77–0.95], Ptrend = 0.004) but not in women, whereas fruit and milk seemed to be more beneficial in women (0.85 [0.76–0.96], Ptrend = 0.005) than in men (0.92 [0.83–1.02], Ptrend = 0.04).
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Foods high in meat and fat appear to confer a higher diabetes risk in all ethnic groups, whereas the effects of other dietary patterns vary by sex and ethnicity.},

FI in cancer survivors may arise as a consequence of financial toxicity stemming from treatment costs, physical impairment, labor force egress, or a combination of those factors. To our knowledge, an understanding of the dietary intake practices of this population has not been delineated but is imperative for addressing the needs of this vulnerable population; (2) Methods: Using data from NHANES, 1999–2018, we characterized major dietary patterns in the food insecure cancer survivor population using: i. penalized logistic regression (logit) and ii. principal components analysis (PCA). We validated these patterns by examining the association of those patterns with food insecurity in the cancer population; (3) Results: Four dietary patterns were extracted with penalized logit and two with PCA. In the pattern validation phase, we found several patterns exhibited strong associations with FI. The FI, SNAP, and Household Size patterns (all extracted with penalized logit) harbored the strongest associations and there was evidence of stronger associations in those moderately removed from a cancer diagnosis (≥2 and {\textless}6 years since diagnosis); (4) Conclusions: FI may play an influential role on the dietary intake patterns of cancer survivors in the U.S. The results highlight the relevance of FI screening and monitoring for cancer survivors.},

            Philosophers agree that causal propositions cannot be proved, and find flaws or practical limitations in all philosophies of causal inference. Hence, the role of logic, belief, and observation in evaluating causal propositions is not settled. Causal inference in epidemiology is better viewed as an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than as a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present or not.},

The objective of this study was to understand the early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income adults in the US as social distancing measures began to be implemented. On 19–24 March 2020 we fielded a national, web-based survey (53\% response rate) among adults with {\textless}250\% of the federal poverty line in the US (N = 1478). Measures included household food security status and COVID-19-related basic needs challenges. Overall, 36\% of low-income adults in the US were food secure, 20\% had marginal food security, and 44\% were food insecure. Less than one in five (18.8\%) of adults with very low food security reported being able to comply with public health recommendations to purchase two weeks of food at a time. For every basic needs challenge, food-insecure adults were significantly more likely to report facing that challenge, with a clear gradient effect based on severity of food security. The short-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are magnifying existing disparities and disproportionately affecting low-income, food-insecure households that already struggle to meet basic needs. A robust, comprehensive policy response is needed to mitigate food insecurity as the pandemic progresses.},

            Utilizing transaction-level financial data, we explore how household consumption responded to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As case numbers grew and cities and states enacted shelter-in-place orders, Americans began to radically alter their typical spending across a number of major categories. In the first half of March 2020, individuals increased total spending by over 40\% across a wide range of categories. This was followed by a decrease in overall spending of 25\%–30\% during the second half of March coinciding with the disease spreading, with only food delivery and grocery spending as major exceptions to the decline. Spending responded most strongly in states with active shelter-in-place orders, though individuals in all states had sizable responses. We find few differences across individuals with differing political beliefs, but households with children or low levels of liquidity saw the largest declines in spending during the latter part of March.},

	abstract = {Background
              Socially vulnerable communities may be at higher risk for COVID-19 outbreaks in the US. However, no prior studies examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. Therefore, we examined temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability to quantify disparities in trends over time.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 15 to December 31, 2020, for each US county using data from USAFacts. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with higher values indicating more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles, adjusting for rurality, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage female, percentage of smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM
                2.5
                ), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, daily temperature and precipitation, and proportion tested for COVID-19.
              
            
            
              Results
              At the outset of the pandemic, the most vulnerable counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than least vulnerable SVI quartile. However, on March 28, we observed a crossover effect in which the most vulnerable counties experienced higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to the least vulnerable counties (RR = 1.05, 95\% PI: 0.98, 1.12). Vulnerable counties had higher death rates starting on May 21 (RR = 1.08, 95\% PI: 1.00,1.16). However, by October, this trend reversed and the most vulnerable counties had lower death rates compared to least vulnerable counties.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties and back again over time.},

                Food deserts (
                FDs
                ), defined as low‐income communities with limited access to healthy food, are a growing public health concern. We evaluated the impact of living in
                FDs
                on incident cardiovascular events.
              
            
            
              Methods and Results
              
                We recruited 4944 subjects (age 64±12, 64\% male) undergoing cardiac catheterization into the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank. Using the US Department of Agriculture definition of
                FD
                , we determined whether their residential addresses had (1) poor access to healthy food, (2) low income, or (3) both (=
                FD
                ). Subjects were prospectively followed for a median of 3.2 years for myocardial infarction (MI) and death. Fine and Gray's subdistribution hazard models for
                MI
                and Cox proportional hazard models for death/
                MI
                were used to examine the association between area characteristics (
                FD
                , poor access, and low income) and the rates of adverse events after adjusting for traditional risk factors. A total of 981 (20\%) lived in
                FDs
                and had a higher adjusted risk of
                MI
                (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.44 [95\%
                CI,
                1.06–1.95]) than those living in non‐
                FDs
                . In a multivariate analysis including both food access and area income, only living in a low‐income area was associated with a higher adjusted risk of
                MI
                (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.40 [1.06–1.85]) and death/
                MI
                (hazard ratio, 1.18 [1.02–1.35]) while living in a poor‐access area was not significantly associated with either (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.05 [0.80–1.38] and hazard ratio, 0.99 [0.87–1.14], respectively).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              
                Living in an FD is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events in those with coronary artery disease. Specifically, low area income of
                FDs
                , not poor access to food, was significantly associated with worse outcomes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The objective of this review is to explore and discuss the concept of local food system resilience in light of the disruptions brought to those systems by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion, which focuses on low and middle income countries, considers also the other shocks and stressors that generally affect local food systems and their actors in those countries (weather-related, economic, political or social disturbances). The review of existing (mainly grey or media-based) accounts on COVID-19 suggests that, with the exception of those who lost members of their family to the virus, as per June 2020 the main impact of the pandemic derives mainly from the lockdown and mobility restrictions imposed by national/local governments, and the consequence that the subsequent loss of income and purchasing power has on people’s food security, in particular the poor. The paper then uses the most prominent advances made recently in the literature on household resilience in the context of food security and humanitarian crises to identify a series of lessons that can be used to improve our understanding of food system resilience and its link to food security in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and other shocks. Those lessons include principles about the measurement of food system resilience and suggestions about the types of interventions that could potentially strengthen the abilities of actors (including policy makers) to respond more appropriately to adverse events affecting food systems in the future.},

Food insecurity and COVID-19 may exacerbate one another through bidirectional links, leading to a syndemic, or sequential disease clusters, which exacerbate one another. Experiencing food insecurity may be associated with macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, which can weaken host defenses, thus increasing susceptibility to COVID-19. Food insecurity is associated with chronic medical conditions, which may afford a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness. People experiencing food insecurity may have increased exposure to COVID-19 while procuring food. People with COVID-19 may be unable to work, generate income, and procure food while quarantined, which may exacerbate food insecurity. Clinicians should screen for food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide referrals to food-assistance programs when appropriate. Policymakers should expand benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to address increases in the depth and breadth of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

              Background
              In the United States, approximately 11\% of households were food insecure prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to describe the prevalence of food insecurity among adults and households with children living in the United States during the pandemic.
            
            
              Methods
              This study utilized social media as a recruitment platform to administer an original online survey on demographics and COVID-related food insecurity. The survey was disseminated through an advertisement campaign on Facebook and affiliated platforms. Food insecurity was assessed with a validated six-item United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Household Food Security Survey Module, which was used to create a six-point numerical food security score, where a higher score indicates lower food security. Individual-level participant demographic information was also collected. Logistic regressions (low/very-low compared with high/marginal food security) were performed to generate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95\%CIs for food insecurity and select demographic characteristics.
            
            
              Results
              Advertisements reached 250,701 individuals and resulted in 5,606 complete surveys. Overall, 14.7\% of participants self-identified as having low or very low food security in their households, with higher prevalence (17.5\%) among households with children. Unemployment (AOR:1.76, 95\%CI:1.09–2.80), high school or lower education (AOR:2.25, 95\%CI:1.29–3.90), and low income (AOR[\$30,000-\$50,000]:5.87, 95\%CI:3.35–10.37; AOR[{\textless} \$30,000]:10.61, 95\%CI:5.50–20.80) were associated with higher odds of food insecurity in multivariable models among households with children (and the whole sample).
            
            
              Conclusions
              These data indicate exacerbation of food insecurity during the pandemic. The study will be instrumental in guiding additional research and time-sensitive interventions targeted towards vulnerable food insecure subgroups.},

	abstract = {Background
              The COVID-19 epidemic in the United States is widespread, with more than 200,000 deaths reported as of September 23, 2020. While ecological studies show higher burdens of COVID-19 mortality in areas with higher rates of poverty, little is known about social determinants of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level.
            
            
              Methods and findings
              
                We estimated the proportions of COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions using their reported univariate proportions among COVID-19 deaths and correlations among these variables in the general population from the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used these proportions to randomly sample individuals from NHANES. We analyzed the distributions of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity, income, education level, and veteran status. We analyzed the association of these characteristics with mortality by logistic regression. Summary demographics of deaths include mean age 71.6 years, 45.9\% female, and 45.1\% non-Hispanic white. We found that disproportionate deaths occurred among individuals with nonwhite race/ethnicity (54.8\% of deaths, 95\% CI 49.0\%–59.6\%,
                p
                {\textless} 0.001), individuals with income below the median (67.5\%, 95\% CI 63.4\%–71.5\%,
                p
                {\textless} 0.001), individuals with less than a high school level of education (25.6\%, 95\% CI 23.4\% –27.9\%,
                p
                {\textless} 0.001), and veterans (19.5\%, 95\% CI 15.8\%–23.4\%,
                p
                {\textless} 0.001). Except for veteran status, these characteristics are significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality in multiple logistic regression. Limitations include the lack of institutionalized people in the sample (e.g., nursing home residents and incarcerated persons), the need to use comorbidity data collected from outside the US, and the assumption of the same correlations among variables for the noninstitutionalized population and COVID-19 decedents.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Substantial inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are likely, with disproportionate burdens falling on those who are of racial/ethnic minorities, are poor, have less education, and are veterans. Healthcare systems must ensure adequate access to these groups. Public health measures should specifically reach these groups, and data on social determinants should be systematically collected from people with COVID-19.},

Human papillomavirus has also been strongly implicated as a causative agent in a subset of these cancers. The complex anatomy and vital physiological role of the tumour-involved structures dictate that the goals of treatment are not only to improve survival outcomes but also to preserve organ function. Major improvements have been accomplished in surgical techniques and radiotherapy delivery. Moreover, systemic therapy including chemotherapy and molecularly targeted agents—namely, the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors—has been successfully integrated into potentially curative treatment of locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In deciding which treatment strategy would be suitable for an individual patient, important considerations include expected functional outcomes, ability to tolerate treatment, and comorbid illnesses. The collaboration of many specialties is the key for optimum assessment and decision making. We review the epidemiology, molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis and staging, and the latest multimodal management of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe relationships between fiber consumption and human cancer rates have been examined, together with an analysis of the effects of individual dietary fibers on the experimental induction of large bowel cancer. The human epidemiology indicates an inverse correlation between high fiber consumption and lower colon cancer rates. Cereal fiber sources show the most consistent negative correlation. However, human case-control studies in general fail to confirm any protective effect due to dietary fiber. Case-control studies indicate that if any source of dietary fiber is possibly antineoplastic then it is probably vegetables. These results may mean that purified fibers alone do not inhibit tumor development, whereas it is likely that some other factors present in vegetables are antineoplastic. Experiments in laboratory animals, using chemical induction of large bowel cancer, have in general shown a protective effect with supplements of poorly fermentable fibers such as wheat bran or cellulose. In contrast, a number of fermentable fiber supplements including pectin, corn bran, oat bran, undegraded carageenan, agar, psyllium, guar gum, and alfalfa have been shown to enhance tumor development. Possible mechanisms by which fibers may inhibit colon tumorigenesis include dilution and adsorption of any carcinogens and/or promoters contained within the intestinal lumen, the modulation of colonic microbial metabolic activity, and biological modification of intestinal epithelial cells. Dietary fibers not only bind carcinogens, bile acids, and other potential toxins but also essential nutrients, such as minerals, which can inhibit the carcinogenic process. Fermentation of fibers within the large bowel results in the production of short chain fatty acids, which in vivo stimulate cell proliferation, while butyrate appears to be antineoplastic in vitro. Evidence suggests that if dietary fibers stimulate cell proliferation during the stage of initiation, then this may lead to tumor enhancement.},

We investigated the association between fiber intake and the risk of HNC using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial. Among 101,700 participants with complete dietary information, 186 participants developed HNC during follow-up (January 1998 to May 2011). Dietary data were collected using a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire (1998–2005). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI), using the Cox proportional hazards model. Higher intake of total fiber, insoluble fiber and soluble fiber was associated with decreased HNC risks, with a significant trend. The HRs of highest vs. the lowest tertile of intake were 0.43 (95\%CI: 0.25–0.76) for total fiber, 0.38 (95\%CI: 0.22–0.65) for insoluble fiber, and 0.44 (95\%CI: 0.25–0.79) for soluble fiber. These inverse association were consistent in oral cavity and pharyngeal cases, but the impact of fiber intake was weaker in laryngeal cases. We did not observe any significant interaction of potential confounders, including smoking and drinking, with total fiber intake on HNC risk. These findings support evidence of a protective role of dietary fiber on HNC risk.},

The sources of data most often used in the United States are the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Nutrient Database for Standard Reference or the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between dietary whole grain consumption and risk of mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We investigated 74 341 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and 43 744 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2010), 2 large prospective cohort studies. All patients were free of CVD and cancer at baseline.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios (HRs) for total mortality and mortality due to CVD and cancer according to quintiles of whole grain consumption, which was updated every 2 or 4 years by using validated food frequency questionnaires.
RESULTS: We documented 26 920 deaths during 2 727 006 person-years of follow-up. After multivariate adjustment for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, and modified Alternate Healthy Eating Index score, higher whole grain intake was associated with lower total and CVD mortality but not cancer mortality: the pooled HRs for quintiles 1 through 5, respectively, of whole grain intake were 1 (reference), 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.95-1.02), 0.98 (95\% CI, 0.95-1.02), 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.93-1.01), and 0.91 (95\% CI, 0.88-0.95) for total mortality (P fortrend {\textless} .001); 1 (reference), 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.88-1.01), 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.87-1.01), 0.87 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.94), and 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.78-0.92) for CVD mortality (P fortrend {\textless} .001); and 1 (reference), 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.96-1.08), 1.05 (95\% CI, 0.99-1.12), 1.04 (95\% CI, 0.98-1.11), and 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.91-1.04) for cancer mortality (P fortrend = .43). We further estimated that every serving (28 g/d) of whole grain consumption was associated with a 5\% (95\% CI, 2\%-7\%) lower total morality or a 9\% (95\% CI, 4\%-13\%) lower CVD mortality, whereas the same intake level was nonsignificantly associated with lower cancer mortality (HR, 0.98; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.02). Similar inverse associations were observed between bran intake and CVD mortality, with a pooled HR of 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.73-0.87; P fortrend {\textless} .001), whereas germ intake was not associated with CVD mortality after adjustment for bran intake.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data indicate that higher whole grain consumption is associated with lower total and CVD mortality in US men and women, independent of other dietary and lifestyle factors. These results are in line with recommendations that promote increased whole grain consumption to facilitate disease prevention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier analyses within the EPIC study showed that dietary fibre intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk, but results from some large cohort studies do not support this finding. We explored whether the association remained after longer follow-up with a near threefold increase in colorectal cancer cases, and if the association varied by gender and tumour location.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After a mean follow-up of 11.0 years, 4,517 incident cases of colorectal cancer were documented. Total, cereal, fruit, and vegetable fibre intakes were estimated from dietary questionnaires at baseline. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age, sex, and centre, and adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, education, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive use, and intakes of alcohol, folate, red and processed meats, and calcium. After multivariable adjustments, total dietary fibre was inversely associated with colorectal cancer (HR per 10 g/day increase in fibre 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.79-0.96). Similar linear associations were observed for colon and rectal cancers. The association between total dietary fibre and risk of colorectal cancer risk did not differ by age, sex, or anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary variables. Fibre from cereals and fibre from fruit and vegetables were similarly associated with colon cancer; but for rectal cancer, the inverse association was only evident for fibre from cereals.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strengthen the evidence for the role of high dietary fibre intake in colorectal cancer prevention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide a tutorial for using propensity score methods with complex survey data.
DATA SOURCES: Simulated data and the 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.
STUDY DESIGN: Using simulation, we compared the following methods for estimating the treatment effect: a naïve estimate (ignoring both survey weights and propensity scores), survey weighting, propensity score methods (nearest neighbor matching, weighting, and subclassification), and propensity score methods in combination with survey weighting. Methods are compared in terms of bias and 95 percent confidence interval coverage. In Example 2, we used these methods to estimate the effect on health care spending of having a generalist versus a specialist as a usual source of care.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In general, combining a propensity score method and survey weighting is necessary to achieve unbiased treatment effect estimates that are generalizable to the original survey target population.
CONCLUSIONS: Propensity score methods are an essential tool for addressing confounding in observational studies. Ignoring survey weights may lead to results that are not generalizable to the survey target population. This paper clarifies the appropriate inferences for different propensity score methods and suggests guidelines for selecting an appropriate propensity score method based on a researcher's goal.},

The United States (U.S.) has recently surpassed 1,000,000 deaths. Individuals who are elderly and/or immunocompromised are the most susceptible to serious sequelae. Rising sentiment often implicates younger, less-vulnerable populations as primary introducers of COVID-19 to communities, particularly around colleges and universities. Adjusting for more than 32 key socio-demographic, economic, and epidemiologic variables, we (1) implemented regressions to determine the overall community-level, age-adjusted COVID-19 case and mortality rate within each American county, and (2) performed a subgroup analysis among a sample of U.S. colleges and universities to identify any significant preliminary mitigation measures implemented during the fall 2020 semester. From January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, a total of 22,385,335 cases and 374,130 deaths were reported to the CDC. Overall, counties with increasing numbers of university enrollment showed significantly lower case rates and marginal decreases in mortality rates. County-level population demographics, and not university level mitigation measures, were the most significant predictor of adjusted COVID-19 case rates. Contrary to common sentiment, our findings demonstrate that counties with high university enrollments may be more adherent to public safety measures and vaccinations, likely contributing to safer communities.},

Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi‐item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52\%), Whites (74\%), non-Hispanic (81\%), married (56\%), employed full time (68\%), and with a bachelor’s degree or higher (77\%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52\%), somewhat likely (27\%), not likely (15\%), definitely not (7\%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34\%), Hispanics (29\%), those who had children at home (25\%), rural dwellers (29\%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25\%), and those who identified as Republicans (29\%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1 year. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, evidence-based communication, mass media strategies, and policy measures will have to be implemented across the U.S. to convert vaccines into vaccinations and mass immunization with special attention to the groups identified in this study.},

Traditionally, nutrition research has focused on single nutrients or specific foods, although individuals do not consume nutrients or foods in isolation. Thus, recent nutritional epidemiologic studies have shifted to dietary pattern analysis, which describes the overall diet; the foods, food groups, and nutrients included; their combination and variety; and the frequency and quantity with which they are habitually consumed (1). Among the most prominent methods to assess dietary patterns are a priori numerical indexes, which measure adherence to a dietary pattern that has been predefined on the basis of previous scientific evidence. Often, multiple indexes describe variations of the same dietary pattern (e.g., Mediterranean diet score) or use different scoring and weighting schemes, such as population-specific intakes [e.g., Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)4] versus fixed cutoffs for recommended intakes (e.g., Alternate Healthy Eating Index). Another approach is to empirically derive common patterns of foods that tend to be consumed together by using principal components analysis or that explain the largest variation in intermediate outcomes such as biomarkers of diseases by using a statistical approach called reduced rank regression (2).},

	abstract = {Dietary guidelines provide evidence-based statements on food choices to meet nutritional requirements and reduce the risk of prevailing chronic disease. They involve a substantial amount of research translation, and their implementation has important health consequences. Foods, however, are complex combinations of nutrients and other compounds that act synergistically within the food and across food combinations. In addition, the evidence base underpinning dietary guidelines accesses research that reflects different study designs, with inherent strengths and limitations. We propose a systematic approach for the review of evidence that begins with research on dietary patterns. This research will identify the combinations of foods that best protect, or appear deleterious to, health. Next, we suggest that evidence be sought from research that focuses on the effects of individual foods. Finally, nutrient-based research should be considered to explain the mechanisms by which these foods and dietary patterns exert their effects, take into account the effects of ingredients added to the food supply, and enable assessments of dietary sufficiency. The consideration of individual nutrients and food components (e.g., upper limits for saturated fat, added sugar, and sodium) provides important benchmarks for evaluating overall diet quality. The concepts of core and discretionary foods (nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor foods, respectively) enable distinctions between foods, and this has implications for the relation between food policy and food manufacturing. In summary, evidence supporting healthy dietary patterns provides the foundation for the development of dietary guidelines. Further reference to individual foods and nutrients follows from the foundation of healthy dietary patterns.},

	abstract = {Conclusions: One third of the patients had cachexia with an association of significantly shorter survival. These results suggest that combining HGS and MAMA seems to be a practical method to screen cachexia in patients with head and neck cancer and may also be used when assessing their prognosis.Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the hypothesis that cachexia defined as both low mid-arm muscle area (MAMA) and handgrip strength (HGS) is associated with decreased survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Methods: Sixty-five consecutive patients with primary HNSCC were enrolled prior to cancer therapy. Cachexia was defined as low handgrip strength (HGS) and low mid-arm muscle area (MAMA). Nutritional status was assessed by patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA) and sarcopenia by low MAMA. Biochemical parameters reflecting nutritional status and S-25-OHD were measured.Results: Cachexia was seen in 31\% and sarcopenia in 46\% of patients. Altogether, 34\% of patients were malnourished. Disease-free survival was 13 months (3–62) in cachectic patients, compared with 66 months (31–78) in non-cachectic patients (p = 0.009). S-25-OHD was 28 nmol/l in cachectic patients, compared with 46 nmol/l in non-cachectic patients (p = 0.009) and prealbumin 187 mg/l and 269 mg/l, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001).},

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3\% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1\% vs. 2.6\% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65\% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus-associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5\%), contributing to a 33\% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2\% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.},

	abstract = {This report presents findings from data collected in December 2019 for the year that preceded the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. An estimated 89.5 percent of U.S. households were food secure throughout the entire year in 2019, with access at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. The remaining households (10.5 percent, down from 11.1 percent in 2018) were food insecure at least some time during the year, including 4.1 percent with very low food security (not significantly different from 4.3 percent in 2018). Very low food security is the more severe range of food insecurity where one or more household members experienced reduced food intake and disrupted eating patterns at times during the year because of limited money and other resources for obtaining food. Among children, changes from 2018 in food insecurity and very low food security were not statistically significant. Children and adults were food insecure in 6.5 percent of U.S. households with children in 2019; very low food security among children was 0.6 percent. In 2019, the typical food-secure household spent 24 percent more on food than the typical food-insecure household of the same size and household composition. About 58 percent of food-insecure households participated in one or more of the three largest Federal nutrition assistance programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps); Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and the National School Lunch Program during the month prior to the 2019 survey.},

I use data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to explore the relationship between food insecurity, the household’s history during the previous year, and SNAP participation. The results indicate that a number of aspects of the household’s recent experience including negative income shocks, moves, and both increases and decreases in household size increase the probability of being food insecure while SNAP participation is estimated to reduce the probability of being food insecure.},

	abstract = {In the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) graded the mortgage security of urban US neighborhoods. In doing so, the HOLC engaged in the practice, imbued with racism and xenophobia, of “redlining” neighborhoods deemed “hazardous” for lenders. Redlining has caused persistent social, political and economic problems for communities of color. Linkages between redlining and contemporary food access remain unexamined, even though food access is essential to well-being. To investigate this, we used a census tract-level measure of low-income and low grocery store food access from the US Department of Agriculture Food Access Research Atlas, redlining data from Mapping Inequality Project, and demographic data from the American Community Survey. We employed generalized estimating equations with robust covariance estimates to analyze data pertaining to 10,459 census tracts in 202 US cities. Tracts that the HOLC graded as “C” (“decline in desirability”) and “D” (“hazardous”) had reduced contemporary food access compared to those graded “A” (“best”). Increases in contemporary census tract proportions of Black, Hispanic, or other racial/ethnic minority residents, as well as disabled residents, were associated with reduced food access. Increases in contemporary proportions of residents age 75 years and older or those without a car were associated with better food access. Tracts that underwent housing redevelopment since being graded had better food access, while those undergoing gentrification had reduced food access. Results suggest that issues of redlining, housing discrimination, racism, ableism, displacement, and food inaccessibility are deeply intertwined.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a management perspective of organisational factors that contributes to the reduction of food waste through the application of design science principles to explore causal relationships between food distribution (organisational) and consumption (societal) factors. Qualitative data were collected with an organisational perspective from commercial food consumers along with large-scale food importers, distributors, and retailers. Cause-effect models are built and “what-if” simulations are conducted through the development and application of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) approaches to elucidate dynamic interrelationships. The simulation models developed provide a practical insight into existing and emergent food losses scenarios, suggesting the need for big data sets to allow for generalizable findings to be extrapolated from a more detailed quantitative exercise. This research offers itself as evidence to support policy makers in the development of policies that facilitate interventions to reduce food losses. It also contributes to the literature through sustaining, impacting and potentially improving levels of food security, underpinned by empirically constructed policy models that identify potential behavioural changes. It is the extension of these simulation models set against a backdrop of a proposed big data framework for food security, where this study sets avenues for future research for others to design and construct big data research in food supply chains. This research has therefore sought to provide policymakers with a means to evaluate new and existing policies, whilst also offering a practical basis through which food chains can be made more resilient through the consideration of management practices and policy decisions.},

IRT allows individual line item validations and offers substantial advantages over classic methods of scale validation or the simplest from of IRT known as Rasch. Rasch analysis reduces data to dichotomous variables thus decreasing the sensitivity of Likert-type data responses.Purpose. The purpose of this study was to create an outcome scale associated with the latent trait of functioning and disability, validated using IRT, in a population with report of cervical pain.Methods. Using the NHANES database, a recently created scale (NHANES ADL scale) was analysed using factor analysis, internal analyses of consistency, IRT, and comparison with internal measures of functioning and disability.Results. The newly created NHANES ADL scale demonstrated uni-dimensionality, was internally reliable, and was correlated to internal measures of functioning and disability. Additionally, the majority of the scale items demonstrate strong discrimination and suitable thresholds.Discussion. The NHANES ADL scale effectively measures physical, social, and emotional disability in patients with a cervical impairment, and may be an efficient measure of perceived limitations from working and generalized daily physical activity.Conclusion. The newly created NHANES ADL scale demonstrates internal consistency, unidimensionality, and line item validity. The NHANES ADL scale appears to be a useful instrument in measurement of functioning and disability in patients with report of cervical pain.},

              To examine the relationship of diabetes and functional disability in older adults and the possible mediating roles of comorbidities and A1C.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 6,097 participants aged ≥60 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2006. Diabetes was defined by self-report. Disability was defined as difficulty performing a physical task. We evaluated disability by grouping 19 physical tasks into five functional groups: lower-extremity mobility (LEM), general physical activities (GPA), activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and leisure and social activities (LSA).
            
            
              RESULTS
              Older U.S. adults with diabetes had the greatest disability in GPA (prevalence 73.6\% [95\% CI 70.2–76.9]), followed by LEM (52.2\% [48.5–55.9]), IADL (43.6\% [40.1–47.2]), ADL (37.2\% [33.1–41.3]), and LSA groups (33.8\% [30.8–36.9]). Diabetes was associated with two to three times increased odds of disability across functional groups (all P \&lt; 0.05). Comorbidities, mostly cardiovascular disease and obesity, and poor glycemic control (A1C ≥8\%) together explained up to 85\% of the excess odds of disability associated with diabetes, whereas poor glycemic control alone explained only ∼10\% of the excess odds. Adjustment for comorbidities, A1C, and diabetes duration fully attenuated the associations of diabetes with disability in all functional groups (all P \&gt; 0.05).
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Older adults with diabetes have a high prevalence of disabilities with variable associations attributable to comorbidities and A1C. Aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors and obesity may significantly reduce the burden of disability in this population.},

Food-insecure adults may consume more highly palatable foods as a coping mechanism, leading to poorer diet quality and increased risks of chronic disease over time. Using data from the 1999-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, this study aimed to examine the cross-sectional differences in dietary intake and diet quality by household food security among 8,129 lower-income adults (≤300\% of the federal poverty level). Food insecurity was assessed using the 18-item US Household Food Security Survey Module. Dietary intake was assessed from 24-hour recalls and diet quality was measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2005 and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010. Relative mean differences in dietary outcomes by household food security were estimated using linear regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Lower-income food-insecure adults reported higher consumption of some highly palatable foods, including high-fat dairy products (P trend{\textless}0.0001) and salty snacks (P trend=0.01) compared with lower-income food-secure adults. Food insecurity was also associated with more sugar-sweetened beverages (P trend=0.003); more red/processed meat (P trend=0.005); more nuts, seeds, and legumes (P trend=0.0006); fewer vegetables (P trend{\textless}0.0001); and fewer sweets and bakery desserts (P trend=0.0002). No differences were observed for intakes of total energy and macronutrients. Food insecurity was significantly associated with lower Healthy Eating Index-2005 (P trend{\textless}0.0001) and Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 scores (P trend{\textless}0.0001). Despite no macronutrient differences, food insecurity was associated with characteristics of poor diet quality known to increase chronic disease risk.},

Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial nonstationarity.
RESULTS: As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5\%, 2,844 of 3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the global level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (eβ=1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (eβ=6.69, p{\textless}0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, on the basis of the local geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale disasters differentially affect the health of marginalized communities. In this study, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. Addressing the social factors that create poor health is essential to reducing inequities in the health impacts of disasters.},

	abstract = {Food insecurity is a significant public health problem in the United States leading to substantial social, economic, and health care?related burdens. While studies continue to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity, the long-term outcomes are not extensively explored. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of food insecurity on mortality. We analyzed data on adults (≥ 20 years) from the 1999?2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, with mortality data obtained through 2015. Among the total study participants (n = 25,247), 17.6\% reported food insecurity. Food-insecure individuals were more likely to be younger in age, minorities, poorer, with lesser education, obese, smokers, and with diabetes compared to food-secure counterparts. During a 10.2-year follow-up, among the food insecure, 821 individuals died (11\%). The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality among the food insecure compared with the food secure, with adjustment for age and gender only, was 1.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI: 1.25, 2.01]. The adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality, HR = 1.46, CI [1.23, 1.72], p {\textless} .001, and cardiovascular mortality, HR = 1.75, CI [1.19, 2.57], p {\textless} .01, were statistically significantly higher among food-insecure individuals, after adjustment for multiple demographic and health risk factors. Individuals who are food-insecure have a significantly higher probability of death from any cause or cardiovascular disease in long-term follow-up. Comprehensive and interdisciplinary approaches to reducing food insecurity?related disparities and health risks should be implemented. Including food insecurity in health risk assessments and addressing food insecurity as a determinant of long-term outcomes may contribute to lower premature death rates.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of household food security, which reflects adequacy and stability of the food supply, has been measured periodically in the United States and occasionally in high-risk groups or specific regions. Despite a plausible biological mechanism to suggest negative health outcomes of food insecurity, this relation has not been adequately evaluated. This study was conducted in the Lower Mississippi Delta region to examine the association between household food insecurity and self-reported health status in adults. A two-stage stratified cluster sample representative of the population in 36 counties in the Delta region of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi was selected using list-assisted random digit dialing telephone methodology. After households were selected and screened, a randomly selected adult was interviewed within each sampled household. Data were collected to measure food security status and self-reported mental, physical, and general health status, using the U.S. Food Security Survey Module and the Short Form 12-item Health Survey (SF-12). Data were reported on a sample of 1488 households. Adults in food-insecure households were significantly more likely to rate their health as poor/fair and scored significantly lower on the physical and mental health scales of the SF-12. In regression models controlling for income, gender, and ethnicity, the interaction between food insecurity status and race was a significant predictor of fair/poor health and lower scores on physical and mental health. Household food insecurity is associated with poorer self-reported health status of adults in this rural, high-risk sample in the Lower Mississippi Delta.},

We use longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics along with fixed-effect methods that control for unobserved heterogeneity to test our hypotheses. Results. We find that, conditional on the food stamp benefit amount, the emotional distress associated with food insufficiency is higher among food stamp participants. Moreover, we find evidence of a dosage effect such that food-insufficient individuals who receive higher amounts of food stamp benefits suffer greater emotional distress than food-insufficient individuals who receive lower levels of food stamp benefits. However, the negative mental health effects of food insufficiency and food stamp participation are driven primarily by periods of transition onto the Food Stamp Program and into food insufficiency. Conclusions. The negative mental health aspects of participating in the Food Stamp Program seem to outweigh the positive mental health aspects, at least during the period of application and initial receipt, suggesting that programmatic reform is needed to improve overall well-being among new participants.},

These objectives were achieved through an analysis of data from the 1996/1997 National Population Health Survey. An estimated 4\% of Canadians, 1.1 million people, were found to be living in food-insufficient households. Single-parent families, households reporting their major source of income as welfare, unemployment insurance or workers' compensation, those who did not own their own homes and households in Western Canada were more likely to report food insufficiency. The likelihood of reporting food insufficiency increased dramatically as income adequacy deteriorated. Individuals from food-insufficient households had significantly higher odds of reporting poor/fair health, of having poor functional health, restricted activity and multiple chronic conditions, of suffering from major depression and distress, and of having poor social support. Individuals in food-insufficient households were also more likely to report heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and food allergies. Men in food-insufficient households were less likely to be overweight; after adjusting for potentially confounding variables, no other associations were found between food insufficiency and body mass index. These findings suggest that food insufficiency is one dimension of a more pervasive vulnerability to a range of physical, mental and social health problems among households struggling with economic constraints.},

	abstract = {Background
Medical financial hardship is an increasingly common consequence of cancer treatment and can lead to food insecurity. However, food security status is not routinely assessed in the health care setting, and the prevalence of food insecurity among cancer survivors is unknown.
Objective
This scoping review aimed to identify the prevalence of food insecurity among cancer survivors in the United States before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], Web of Science, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) were systematically searched for articles that reported on food security status among US patients receiving active cancer treatment or longer-term cancer survivors and were published between January 2015 and December 2020.
Results
Among the 15 articles meeting the inclusion criteria, overall food insecurity prevalence ranged from 4.0\% among women presenting to a gynecologic oncology clinic to 83.6\% among patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers. Excluding studies focused specifically on Federally Qualified Health Center patients, prevalence of food insecurity ranged from 4.0\% to 26.2\%, which overlaps the food insecurity prevalence in the general US population during the same time period (range, 10.5\% to 14.9\%). Women were more likely than men to report being food insecure, and the prevalence of food insecurity was higher among Hispanic and Black patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients.
Conclusions
Given significant heterogeneity in study populations and sample sizes, it was not possible to estimate an overall food insecurity prevalence among cancer survivors in the United States. Routine surveillance of food security status and other social determinants of health is needed to better detect and address these issues.},

This study documents the quality of diets among older Americans and implications of healthy eating for their physical and mental health.

	abstract = {Background: Inflammation and immune response have potential prognostic implications for breast cancer survivors. We examined how postdiagnosis diet quality is cross-sectionally related to biomarkers of inflammation and adipose-derived hormones among breast cancer survivors and determined whether physical activity or body size modified any observed associations.Methods: Participants included 746 women diagnosed with stage 0 to IIIA breast cancer. Thirty months after diagnosis, the women completed food frequency questionnaires. We scored diet quality with the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2005. Serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A, leptin, and adiponectin were measured in fasting 30 mL blood samples. Log biomarker values were regressed on quartiles of HEI-2005 scores in multivariate models, and β scores were exponentiated and expressed as geometric means within quartiles of HEI-2005 scores.Results: Women with better versus poor quality postdiagnosis diets, as defined by higher HEI-2005 scores (Q4 versus Q1), had lower concentrations of CRP (1.6 mg/L versus 2.5 mg/L), but no significant difference in concentrations of serum amyloid A, leptin, or adiponectin. Among women not engaging in recreational physical activity after diagnosis, better diet quality was associated with lower CRP concentrations (2.5 mg/L versus 5.0 mg/L), but no association was observed among women engaging in any recreational physical activity (1.4 mg/L versus 1.6 mg/L; P heterogeneity = 0.03).Conclusions: Among breast cancer survivors, a better-quality diet seems to be associated with lower levels of chronic inflammation.Impact: Lower levels of chronic inflammation have been associated with improved survival after breast cancer.

	abstract = {Objective:
To understand how diet quality affects chronic disease etiology, the associations of four a priori diet quality indices with blood levels of lipid-soluble micronutrients and biomarkers of inflammation, lipid and glucose metabolism were examined in five ethnic groups.

Methods:
In a cross-sectional design, the Adiposity Phenotype Study, a subset of the Multiethnic Cohort in Hawaii and Los Angeles, recruited participants of white, African American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese American, and Latino ancestry. A total of 896 men and 910 women completed a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire and anthropometric measurements, and donated a fasting blood sample. Using general linear models, covariate-adjusted mean levels of lipid-soluble micronutrients (total carotenes, lycopene, total tocopherols, total lutein, cryptoxanthins), biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, TNF-α), adipokines (adiponectin, leptin), lipids (total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides), and glucose metabolism (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR) were computed across tertiles of four a priori dietary indices (HEI-2010, AHEI, aMED, DASH); trends were evaluated in models with diet quality scores as continuous variables.

Results:
With better diet quality, levels of carotenes, lutein, cryptoxanthin, adiponectin, and HDL were significantly higher (ptrend{\textless}0.01), whereas levels of CRP, leptin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR were inversely associated (ptrend{\textless}0.05) with diet quality. With the exception of cryptoxanthins and triglycerides, the associations were consistent across ethnic groups.

Conclusion:
These findings confirm the association between diet quality and nutrition-related biomarkers and support the idea that a high quality diet positively influences biologic pathways involved in chronic disease etiology across different ethnic groups.},

	abstract = {Inflammation is a facilitating process for multiple cancer types. It is believed to affect cancer development and progression through several etiologic pathways, including increased levels of DNA adduct formation, increased angiogenesis, and altered antiapoptotic signaling. This review highlights the application of inflammatory biomarkers in epidemiologic studies and discusses the various cellular mediators of inflammation characterizing the innate immune system response to infection and chronic insult from environmental factors. Included is a review of six classes of inflammation-related biomarkers: cytokines/chemokines, immune-related effectors, acute-phase proteins, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase-related factors, and mediators such as transcription factors and growth factors. For each of these biomarkers, we provide a brief overview of the etiologic role in the inflammation response and how they have been related to cancer etiology and progression within the literature. We provide a discussion of the common techniques available for quantification of each marker, including strengths, weaknesses, and potential pitfalls. Subsequently, we highlight a few under-studied measures to characterize the inflammatory response and their potential utility in epidemiologic studies of cancer. Finally, we suggest integrative methods for future studies to apply multifaceted approaches to examine the relationship between inflammatory markers and their roles in cancer development.

	abstract = {The association of chronic inflammation with colorectal cancer recurrence and death is not well understood, and data from large well-designed prospective cohorts are limited.To assess the associations of inflammatory biomarkers with survival among patients with stage III colon cancer.This cohort study was derived from a National Cancer Institute–sponsored adjuvant chemotherapy trial Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Southwest Oncology Group 80702 (CALGB/SWOG 80702) conducted between June 22, 2010, and November 20, 2015, with follow-up ending on August 10, 2020. A total of 1494 patients with plasma samples available for inflammatory biomarker assays were included. Data were analyzed from July 29, 2021, to February 27, 2022.Plasma inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor 2 [sTNF-αR2], and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]; quintiles) that were assayed 3 to 8 weeks after surgery but before chemotherapy randomization.The primary outcome was disease-free survival, defined as time from randomization to colon cancer recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratios for the associations of inflammatory biomarkers and survival were estimated via Cox proportional hazards regression.Of 1494 patients (median follow-up, 5.9 years [IQR, 4.7-6.1 years]), the median age was 61.3 years (IQR, 54.0-68.8 years), 828 (55.4\%) were male, and 327 recurrences, 244 deaths, and 387 events for disease-free survival were observed. Plasma samples were collected at a median of 6.9 weeks (IQR, 5.6-8.1 weeks) after surgery. The median plasma concentration was 3.8 pg/mL (IQR, 2.3-6.2 pg/mL) for IL-6, 2.9 × 103 pg/mL (IQR, 2.3-3.6 × 103 pg/mL) for sTNF-αR2, and 2.6 mg/L (IQR, 1.2-5.6 mg/L) for hsCRP. Compared with patients in the lowest quintile of inflammation, patients in the highest quintile of inflammation had a significantly increased risk of recurrence or death (adjusted hazard ratios for IL-6: 1.52 [95\% CI, 1.07-2.14]; P = .01 for trend; for sTNF-αR2: 1.77 [95\% CI, 1.23-2.55]; P \&lt; .001 for trend; and for hsCRP: 1.65 [95\% CI, 1.17-2.34]; P = .006 for trend). Additionally, a significant interaction was not observed between inflammatory biomarkers and celecoxib intervention for disease-free survival. Similar results were observed for recurrence-free survival and overall survival.This cohort study found that higher inflammation after diagnosis was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes among patients with stage III colon cancer. This finding warrants further investigation to evaluate whether anti-inflammatory interventions may improve colon cancer outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01150045},

	abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Introduction:}} Increasing evidence demonstrates a crucial role of inflammation in inducing and promoting several cancers. Pro-inflammatory upregulation of cytokines such as IL-6 has been implicated in cervical cancer development and progression through several mechanisms, for example, by inducing platelet production, activation, and aggregation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effective prognostic impact of inflammatory biomarkers such as platelet count, platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and IL-6 in cervical cancer patients. \textbf{\textit{Materials and Methods:}} Between 2016 and 2019, 108 out of 159 patients with cervical cancer have been enrolled. Cutoff level of pretreatment platelet count and PLR was identified by using the ROC curve. IL-6 tumoral and peritumoral expression was analyzed and stratified as low and high (low expression: 0 and +1; marked expression: +2 and +3). \textbf{\textit{Results:}} Median follow-up duration was 30 months (range 16–44). Patients with higher platelet counts showed worse DFS and OS (DFS \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001; OS \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001). Cumulative rates of DFS and OS in patients with lower PLR were higher than in patients with higher values of PLR (DFS \textit{p} = 0.032; OS \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001). Survival analysis showed a better prognosis in patients with lower IL-6 expression (DFS \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001; OS \textit{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001). \textbf{\textit{Conclusion:}} Nowadays, causal relationship between inflammation, innate immunity, and cancer is more widely accepted. However, many of the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating this relationship remain unresolved. Ongoing inflammatory response was associated with poor outcomes in cervical cancer patients. A higher pretreatment platelet count and PLR value associated with higher IL-6 tumoral expression could be used to predict poor prognosis in cervical cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To examine associations of pre-diagnosis high-sensitivity C-reactive (hsCRP) with breast cancer incidence and post-diagnosis survival and to assess whether associations are modified by Body Mass Index (BMI).

Methods
A prospective analysis of the Women’s Health Initiative was conducted among 17,841 cancer free postmenopausal women with baseline hsCRP measurements. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between hsCRP concentrations and: 1) breast cancer risk (n cases=1,114) and 2) all-cause mortality after breast cancer diagnosis. Hazard ratios are per 1 standard deviation in log hsCRP.

Results
hsCRP was not associated with breast cancer risk overall (HR =1.05; 95\% CI, 0.98, 1.12); however, an interaction between BMI and hsCRP was observed (p-interaction=0.02). A 1 SD increase in log hsCRP was associated with 17\% increased breast cancer risk (HR=1.17, 95\% CI=1.03, 1.33) among lean women (BMI{\textless}25), whereas no association was observed among overweight/obese (BMI≥25) women. Pre-diagnosis hsCRP was not associated with overall mortality (HR=1.04; 95\% CI=0.88, 1.21) after breast cancer diagnosis; however, an increased mortality risk was apparent among leaner women with higher hsCRP levels (HR=1.39, 95\% CI= 1.03, 1.88).

Conclusion
Pre-diagnosis hsCRP levels are not associated with postmenopausal breast cancer incidence or survival overall; however, increased risks are suggested among leaner women. The observed effect modification is in the opposite direction of a previous case-control study finding and warrants further investigation.

Impact
Associations of higher CRP levels with incident breast cancer and survival after breast cancer may depend on BMI.},

The tumor response to neoadjuvant RCT is a major determinant of further therapeutic strategies, whether surgery or a continuation of RCT, and therefore, also of the patient's overall prognosis. The present study included patients with histologically proven squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. The C‑reactive protein (CRP) level was measured prior to and following the completion of neoadjuvant RCT. Only CRP measurements taken within 2 weeks of the start of RCT were analyzed. Further measurements were then taken at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 and 40 weeks following RCT. CRP levels were high prior to treatment; however, eventually decreased and normalized following the therapy. In univariate analysis, pre‑therapeutic CRP levels had a significant influence on the response rate (P=0.033), whilst post‑therapeutic CRP levels had no significant influence (P=0.383). Pre‑therapeutic CRP levels, however, not post‑therapeutic CRP levels were significantly correlated with the response rate (P=0.045 and P=0.444, respectively), and no association was observed between CRP levels and survival. This preliminary data indicated that the pre‑therapeutic serum CRP level is a possible indicator of treatment response to RCT.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Chronic inflammation is believed to contribute to the development and progression of breast cancer. Systemic C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) are measures of low-grade chronic inflammation and potential predictors of cancer survival.

Patients and Methods
We evaluated the relationship between circulating markers of inflammation and breast cancer survival using data from the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study (a multiethnic prospective cohort study of women diagnosed with stage 0 to IIIA breast cancer). Circulating concentrations of CRP and SAA were measured approximately 31 months after diagnosis and tested for associations with disease-free survival (approximately 4.1 years of follow-up) and overall survival (approximately 6.9 years of follow-up) in 734 disease-free breast cancer survivors. Cox proportional hazards models were used with adjustment for potential confounding factors to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs.

Results
Elevated SAA and CRP were associated with reduced overall survival, regardless of adjustment for age, tumor stage, race, and body mass index (SAA P trend {\textless} .0001; CRP P trend = .002). The HRs for SAA and CRP tertiles suggested a threshold effect on survival, rather than a dose-response relationship (highest v lowest tertile: SAA HR = 3.15; 95\% CI, 1.73 to 5.65; CRP HR = 2.27; 95\% CI, 1.27 to 4.08). Associations were similar and still significant after adjusting for self-reported history of cardiovascular events and censoring cardiovascular disease deaths. Elevated CRP and SAA were also associated with reduced disease-free survival, although these associations were of borderline significance (SAA P trend = .04; CRP P trend = .07).

Conclusion
Circulating SAA and CRP may be important prognostic markers for long-term survival in breast cancer patients, independent of race, tumor stage, and body mass index.},

Future long-term larger scale studies are needed to further assess the utilization, as well as the impact of food assistance programs such as the this one, on nutritional outcomes, cancer outcomes, comorbidities, and quality of life.

We examined which groups most commonly face unmet food and medication needs.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data from chronically ill participants (self-report of arthritis, diabetes mellitus, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or presence of a "psychiatric problem") aged ≥20 years, in the 2011 National Health Interview Survey. We fit logistic regression models to identify factors associated with food insecurity, cost-related medication underuse, or both.
RESULTS: There were 9696 adult National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) participants who reported chronic illness; 23.4\% reported cost-related medication underuse; 18.8\% reported food insecurity; and 11\% reported both. Adults who reported food insecurity were significantly more likely to report cost-related medication underuse (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.03). Participants with both cost-related medication underuse and food insecurity were more likely to be Hispanic (aOR 1.58), non-Hispanic black (aOR 1.58), and have more chronic conditions (aOR per additional chronic condition 1.56) than patients reporting neither. They also were less likely to have public, non-Medicare insurance (aOR 0.70) and report participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Woman, Infants, and Children (aOR 0.39).
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 in 3 chronically ill NHIS participants are unable to afford food, medications, or both. WIC and public health insurance participation are associated with less food insecurity and cost-related medication underuse.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE
Food insecurity is prevalent among low-income immigrant and minority patients with cancer. To our knowledge, this randomized controlled trial is the first to prospectively examine the impact on cancer outcomes of food insecurity interventions, with the goal of informing
evidence-based interventions to address food insecurity in patients with cancer.
METHODS
A three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted among food-insecure (18-item US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module score ≥ 3) patients with cancer
(N = 117) at four New York City safety net cancer clinics. Arms included a hospital cancer clinic–based food pantry (arm 1), food voucher plus pantry (arm 2), and home grocery delivery plus pantry (arm 3). Treatment completion (primary outcome) and full appointment attendance were assessed
at 6 months. Food security status, depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and quality-of-life scores (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) were assessed at baseline and at 6 months.
RESULTS
Voucher plus pantry had the highest treatment completion
rate (94.6\%), followed by grocery delivery plus pantry (82.5\%) and pantry (77.5\%; P = .046). Food security scores improved significantly in all arms, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scores improved significantly in the pantry and
delivery plus pantry arms.
CONCLUSION
Our findings in this preliminary study suggest that voucher plus pantry was the most effective intervention at improving treatment completion, and it met our a priori criterion for a promising intervention (≥ 90\%). All interventions
demonstrated the potential to improve food security among medically underserved, food-insecure patients with cancer at risk of impaired nutrition status, reduced quality of life, and poorer survival. All patients with cancer should be screened for food insecurity, with evidence-based food
insecurity interventions made available.},

As medical debt grows for some with cancer, the downstream effects can be catastrophic, with a recent study suggesting a link between extreme financial distress and worse mortality. At least three factors might explain the relationship between extreme financial distress and greater risk of mortality: 1) overall poorer well-being, 2) impaired health-related quality of life, and 3) sub-par quality of care. While research has described the financial harm associated with cancer treatment, little has been done to effectively intervene on the problem. Long-term solutions must focus on policy changes to reduce unsustainable drug prices and promote innovative insurance models. In the mean time, patients continue to struggle with high out-of-pocket costs. For more immediate solutions, we should look to the oncologist and patient. Oncologists should focus on the value of care delivered, encourage patient engagement on the topic of costs, and be better educated on financial resources available to patients. For their part, patients need improved cost-related health literacy so they are aware of potential costs and resources, and research should focus on how patients define high-value care. With a growing list of financial side effects induced by cancer treatment, the time has come to intervene on the “financial toxicity” of cancer care.},

	abstract = {“Financial toxicity” has now become a familiar term used in the discussion of cancer drugs, and it is gaining traction in the literature given the high price of newer classes of therapies. However, as a phenomenon in the contemporary treatment and care of people with cancer, financial toxicity is not fully understood, with the discussion on mitigation mainly geared toward interventions at the health system level. Although important, health policy prescriptions take time before their intended results manifest, if they are implemented at all. They require corresponding strategies at the individual patient level. In this review, the authors discuss the nature of financial toxicity, defined as the objective financial burden and subjective financial distress of patients with cancer, as a result of treatments using innovative drugs and concomitant health services. They discuss coping with financial toxicity by patients and how maladaptive coping leads to poor health and nonhealth outcomes. They cover management strategies for oncologists, including having the difficult and urgent conversation about the cost and value of cancer treatment, availability of and access to resources, and assessment of financial toxicity as part of supportive care in the provision of comprehensive cancer care.

Employer accommodations, such as schedule flexibility, have been associated with job retention in higher-income whites, but the role of such accommodations in job retention among low-income minorities is not well understood. We conducted a longitudinal study of 267 employed women ages 18–64 who were undergoing treatment for early-stage breast cancer and spoke English, Chinese, Korean, or Spanish. We categorized patients by income level and by race/ethnicity. The category with the lowest job retention after treatment was low-income women (57 percent). Job retention varied widely by race/ethnicity, ranging from 68 percent among Chinese women to 98 percent among non-Latina whites. Women who had accommodating employers were more than twice as likely to retain their jobs as those without accommodating employers. Low-income women were less likely than higher-income women to have accommodating employers, however. More uniform implementation of accommodations across low- and high-paying jobs could reduce disparities in employment outcomes among workers with a cancer diagnosis. Additional research is needed to better understand the barriers that employers, particularly those with low-income workers, may face in providing accommodations.},

            It is well known that malnutrition is a frequent co-morbidity in cancer patients, especially in those with head and neck neoplasms. This may be due both to the presence of dysphagia symptoms and to the appearance of adverse effects on chemotherapy and / or radiotherapy. The aim of this retrospective observational multicentric study is to evaluate the nutritional status between dysphagia cancer patients and non-dysphagia cancer patients. Data from 60 patients were analysed, 31 of which without dysphagia and 29 with dysphagia. Results highlight that patients with dysphagia had higher involuntary body weight loss than non-dysphagia ones (p {\textless} 0.001). By analysing the entire population, it stands out a weight loss rate of 12 ± 9\% compared to the usual weight was observed and a prevalence of moderate / severe malnutrition diagnosis of 53\%. Furthermore, 76\% of the population who manifested the symptom of dysphagia presented severe malnutrition already at the first visit, compared to 32\% of non-dysphagia subjects.},

	abstract = {Background: As a result of tumor location and treatment that is aggressive, head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors experience an array of symptoms impacting the ability and desire to eat termed nutrition impact symptoms (NISs). Despite increasing cancer survival time, the majority of research studies examining the impact of NISs have been based on clinical samples of HNC patients during the acute phase of treatment. NISs are often chronic and persist beyond the completion of treatment or may develop as late side effects. Therefore, our research team examined chronic NIS complications on HNC survivors’ functional status, quality of life, and diet quality. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 42 HNC survivors who were at least 6 months post-radiation. Self-reported data on demographics, NISs, quality of life, and usual diet over the past year were obtained. Objective measures of functional status included the short physical performance battery and InBody© 270 body composition testing. NISs were coded so a lower score indicated lower symptom burden, (range 4–17) and dichotomized as ≤10 vs. {\textgreater}10, the median in the dataset. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed between the dichotomized NIS summary score and continuous quality of life and functional status outcomes. Diet quality for HNC survivors was calculated using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015). Wilcoxon rank sum tests examined the difference between the HNC HEI-2015 as compared to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data calculated using the population ratio method. Results: A lower NIS score was statistically associated with higher posttreatment lean muscle mass (p = 0.002). A lower NIS score was associated with higher functional (p = 0.0006), physical (p = 0.0007), emotional (p = 0.007), and total (p {\textless} 0.0001) quality of life. Compared to NHANES controls, HNC survivors reported a significantly lower HEI-2015 diet quality score (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Lower NIS burden was associated with higher lean muscle mass and functional, physical, emotional, and total quality of life in post-radiation HNC survivors. HNC survivors reported a significantly lower total HEI-2015 as compared to healthy NHANES controls, providing support for the hypothesis that chronic NIS burden impacts the desire and ability to eat. The effects of this pilot study were strong enough to be detected by straight forward statistical approaches and warrant a larger longitudinal study. For survivors most impacted by NIS burden, multidisciplinary post-radiation exercise and nutrition-based interventions to manage NISs and improve functional status, quality of life, and diet quality in this survivor population are needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The leading cause of death in patients who have had curatively treated early-stage head and neck cancer is a second primary cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract (lung, esophagus, larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity cancers). Low fruit and vegetable intake has been associated with increased risk of primary head and neck cancer and the available data suggest that increasing intake following diagnosis may reduce the risk of a second primary cancer. The goal of this study was to develop and test an easily administered intervention to increase fruit and vegetable intake in these patients following diagnosis and treatment. The 6-month intervention was based on the Stage of Change model. Seventy-five early-stage head and neck cancer patients were randomized to either the intervention group or to the “blinded” control group, with diet change data available on 65 patients. Fruit and vegetable intake, assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and plasma carotenoid concentrations were measured at baseline and at the end of the study period. The change in self-reported intake of fruit and vegetables (servings per day) over the study period was significantly greater (P = 0.009) in the intervention group (n = 35; +2.1) compared with the control group (n = 30; +0.5). Total plasma carotenoids, a biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake, increased by 70 nmol/L in the intervention group as compared with a reduction of 42 nmol/L in the control group, a relative difference of 12\% (nonsignificant). An intervention that can be delivered in a physician's office resulted in a significant increase in intake of fruit and vegetables in early-stage head and neck cancer patients.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Background: “Second cancers” can be thought of in two general categories: (a) those occurring as a consequence of cancer treatment and (b) primary cancers that are thought to develop largely as a consequence of prior lifestyle habits (e.g., chronic smoking, drinking, sun exposures), genetic susceptibility, or interactions of the two. Because there has been limited work on chemoprevention of treatment-related secondary cancers, this minireview will focus on chemoprevention of second cancers with lifestyle/genetic origins.
            Methods/Results: Trials aimed at preventing second cancers in patients with tobacco-related cancers (head and neck, lung), skin cancers, breast cancer, and colorectal adenomatous polyps have been completed with some success. However, one finding that has emerged is that, across several cancer sites, subgroups are found with differential response to the chemopreventive agent. For example, smoking status, alcohol consumption, nutritional status, and host tumor characteristics seem to modify chemopreventive efficacy. Stratum-specific (subgroup) findings may occur by chance, requiring a need for supportive evidence from observational epidemiologic studies of the agent (where available), mechanistic studies, or results of other related trials.
            Conclusions: Although chemoprevention of second cancers has been realized, it has become increasingly apparent that not all benefit equally. The finding of subgroup effects in completed trials results in the need to consider such subgroup effects in the design of future trials, by either restricting enrollment to particular subgroups (e.g., never or former smokers), or by increasing sample size requirements to allow for variation in response in subgroups in a statistically powerful way.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study assessed health literacy, HPV knowledge, utilization and trust in information sources among patients with incident HPV-positive or HPV-negative OSCC diagnosed at the Ohio State University from 2011 to 2015. Health literacy was assessed with a standardized scale. Additional questions evaluated HPV knowledge (including transmission, prevalence, health consequences and treatment), the frequency and type of information sources sought, and trust in those sources.
RESULTS: Surveys were collected from 372 OSCC cases (HPV-positive, n=188; HPV-negative, n=184). Despite high mean health literacy scores, only 45.2\% of HPV-related knowledge questions were answered correctly. HPV was known to be a sexually transmitted infection and a cause of cervical and anal cancer by 66.0\%, 56.5\% and 15.2\%, respectively. In all domains, cases with HPV-positive OSCC were significantly more informed than HPV-negative cases (for all, p{\textless}0.01). Only 52.7\% and 56.2\% of patients with HPV-positive OSCC felt they knew enough to be comfortable discussing HPV with their doctor or sexual partner, respectively. The most frequently used information source was the internet (80.9\%), which ranked 8th in trust of 15 possible sources. Although most (95.5\%) patients trusted information from their doctors, only 37.9\% used doctors as an information source.
CONCLUSIONS: Doctors are a highly trusted, but infrequent utilized, information source and should facilitate patient access to high-quality HPV information sources.},

Suboptimal health literacy has been linked to poor health outcomes. This study assessed health literacy in patients treated for head and neck or lung cancer and associations between health literacy and demographic factors and distress levels.
METHODS: Consecutive English-speaking patients were approached at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. Health literacy was assessed using the Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and Health Literacy Management Scale (HeLMS). Distress was assessed by the Distress Thermometer.
RESULTS: Response rate was 73 \% (n = 93). Using S-TOFHLA, prevalence of inadequate and marginal health literacy was 5.4 and 6.5 \% respectively, and both groups were associated with older age (p = 0.043) and low education level (p = 0.009). Specific assessment of S-TOFHLA revealed that 70 \% could not interpret prescription labels. HeLMS reported that 17 \% had health literacy difficulties. Low scores on domains of HeLMS were associated with lower education level (p {\textless} 0.05) but younger age (p {\textless} 0.05). Distress was not associated with S-TOFHLA scores but related to low scores in two domains of HeLMS (p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Using two different measures, a substantial proportion of patients have poor health literacy abilities and may experience difficulties in accessing health services.},

Survivors had to be ≥1-year postcompletion of treatment to be included in the analysis. Health literacy was assessed via self-report with the Brief Health Literacy Screen (score {\textless}10 indicating inadequate health literacy), and QOL was measured using the University of Washington QOL questionnaire. Linear regression with robust standard errors was utilized to evaluate the association between health literacy and QOL.
RESULTS: Of the 218 survivors evaluated, 13.8\% (n = 30) demonstrated inadequate health literacy. After adjusting for age, marital status, site, stage, treatment modality, and years since treatment completion, social-emotional QOL scores for survivors with adequate health literacy were estimated to be 10.67 points higher than those with inadequate health literacy (P = .013). Health literacy was not significantly associated with physical QOL after adjusting for covariates (P = .130).
CONCLUSION: Inadequate health literacy is associated with a lower social QOL in HNC survivors, and among those with inadequate health literacy, interventions to ameliorate the impact on QOL are needed.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Little is known about whether health literacy is associated with affects certain key outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. We investigated (i) the socio-demographic and clinical profile of health literacy and (ii) associations among between health literacy and self-management behaviours, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and fear of recurrence (FoR) in HNC survivors.
METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted in Ireland. Health literacy was assessed using a validated single-item question. Socio-demographic, clinical and psychosocial outcome variables (FoR, self-management behaviours, HRQL) were collected. Multivariable linear regression was performed to estimate associations between health literacy and each psychosocial outcome.
RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-five (50\%) individuals responded to the survey. Inadequate health literacy was evident among 47\% of the sample. In adjusted models, HNC survivors with inadequate health literacy had significantly lower levels of self-management behaviours in the domains of health-directed behaviour, positive and active engagement in life, self-monitoring and insight, constructive attitudes and approaches and skills and technique acquisition. Inadequate health literacy was independently associated with lower functional well-being and HNC disease-specific HRQL. FoR was also significantly higher among those with inadequate health literacy.
CONCLUSIONS: HNC survivors with inadequate health literacy have lower levels of self-management behaviours, lower functional HRQL and increased FoR compared to those with adequate health literacy.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Clinicians, healthcare providers and those developing interventions should consider how inadequate health literacy among HNC survivors might affect post-treatment outcomes when developing services and providing support for this group.},

DESIGN: This instrument validation study included a cross-sectional sample participating in up to 2 visits 1 month apart.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 429 adults with nutrition-related chronic disease were recruited from clinics and a patient registry affiliated with a Midwestern university medical center.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nutrition literacy was measured by the NLit, which was composed of 6 subscales: nutrition and health, energy sources in food, food label and numeracy, household food measurement, food groups, and consumer skills. Diet quality was measured by Healthy Eating Index-2010 with nutrient data from Diet History Questionnaire II surveys.
ANALYSIS: The researchers measured factor validity and reliability by using binary confirmatory factor analysis; test-retest reliability was measured by Pearson r and the intraclass correlation coefficient, and relationships between nutrition literacy and diet quality were analyzed by linear regression.
RESULTS: The NLit demonstrated substantial factor validity and reliability (0.97; confidence interval, 0.96-0.98) and test-retest reliability (0.88; confidence interval, 0.85-0.90). Nutrition literacy was the most significant predictor of diet quality (β = .17; multivariate coefficient = 0.10; P {\textless} .001).

DESIGN: We identified distinct dietary patterns using principal covariates regression (PCovR) and principal components analysis (PCA) from the Diet History Questionnaire II. Nutrition literacy was assessed using the Nutrition Literacy Assessment Instrument (NLit). Cross-sectional relationships between dietary pattern adherence and global and domain-specific NLit scores were tested by multiple linear regression. Mean differences in diet pattern adherence among three predefined nutrition literacy performance categories were tested by ANOVA.
SETTING: Metropolitan Kansas City, USA.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n 386) with at least one of four diet-related diseases.
RESULTS: Three diet patterns of interest were derived: a PCovR prudent pattern and PCA-derived Western and Mediterranean patterns. After controlling for age, sex, BMI, race, household income, education level and diabetes status, PCovR prudent pattern adherence positively related to global NLit score (P \&lt; 0·001, β = 0·36), indicating more intake of prudent diet foods with improved nutrition literacy. Validating the PCovR findings, PCA Western pattern adherence inversely related to global NLit (P = 0·003, β = -0·13) while PCA Mediterranean pattern positively related to global NLit (P = 0·02, β = 0·12). Using predefined cut points, those with poor nutrition literacy consumed more foods associated with the Western diet (fried foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, red meat, processed foods) while those with good nutrition literacy consumed more foods associated with prudent and Mediterranean diets (vegetables, olive oil, nuts).
CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition literacy predicted adherence to healthy/unhealthy diet patterns. These findings warrant future research to determine if improving nutrition literacy effectively improves eating patterns.},

Reliability of NLit-P was assessed by confirmatory factor analysis. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used.
RESULTS: Fair to substantial reliability was seen across 5 NLit-P domains, whereas Pearson correlations support concurrent validity for the NLit-P related to child diet quality and parental income, age, and educational attainment (P {\textless} .001). For every 1\% increase in NLit-P, there was a 0.51 increase in child Healthy Eating Index (multivariate coefficient, 0.174; P {\textless} .001).

These side effects can profoundly impact nutritional status and quality of life. The purpose of this study was to explore experiences with nutrition-related cancer treatment side effects among cancer patients and their family caregivers, the way they manage such side effects, and the resulting changes in food preferences and behaviors. Structured surveys and in-depth interviews were conducted. Interviews focused on the presence and management of treatment side effects, how those changes influenced food preferences, and the extent to which they interfered with quality of life. Most patients (72\%) reported treatment side effects; 61\% reported that these side effects impacted their eating and drinking. Common side effects included fatigue (58\%), dry mouth (30\%), nausea (24\%), constipation (20\%) and diarrhea (20\%). Six overarching qualitative themes were identified: Spiral of side effects; Pain of eating; Burden of eating; Loss of taste/change in taste; Symptom management; and Solutions. The authors conclude with implications for food and nutrition practice—moving beyond traditional recommendations of what to eat or avoid—to consider the overall patient and caregiver experience.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              This review provides a summary of the current understanding of the health and well-being of the head and neck cancer (HNC) caregiver. Our goal is to understand the healthcare needs required by the caregivers of our oncologic patients, which may ultimately influence quality of care and support that cancer patients require during treatment and recovery.
            
            
              Methods:
              Independent database searches were conducted to identify articles describing HNC caregiver health and healthcare utilization. Search terms included key synonyms for head and neck cancer, caregiver, psychological stress, anxiety, depression, mental health service, and delivery of healthcare in the title/abstract.
            
            
              Results:
              After following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Protocol, a total of 21 studies were included. Among the 21 studies in the review, a total of 1745 caregivers were included. The average age was 57 years, the majority were female (58\%-100\%), and spouses/partners of the patients (77\%). The literature demonstrates significant anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and physical health decline in addition to multifaceted unmet physical and mental health needs among HNC caregivers.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              There is no standard for examining HNC caregiver healthcare needs, while there is evidence of increased healthcare utilization. The literature is limited regarding medical burdens faced by caregivers. Future research is needed to assess the physical health and comorbidities of HNC caregivers and their engagement with the healthcare system to guide further implementation of support models to address the needs of this population.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Background: “Second cancers” can be thought of in two general categories: (a) those occurring as a consequence of cancer treatment and (b) primary cancers that are thought to develop largely as a consequence of prior lifestyle habits (e.g., chronic smoking, drinking, sun exposures), genetic susceptibility, or interactions of the two. Because there has been limited work on chemoprevention of treatment-related secondary cancers, this minireview will focus on chemoprevention of second cancers with lifestyle/genetic origins.
            Methods/Results: Trials aimed at preventing second cancers in patients with tobacco-related cancers (head and neck, lung), skin cancers, breast cancer, and colorectal adenomatous polyps have been completed with some success. However, one finding that has emerged is that, across several cancer sites, subgroups are found with differential response to the chemopreventive agent. For example, smoking status, alcohol consumption, nutritional status, and host tumor characteristics seem to modify chemopreventive efficacy. Stratum-specific (subgroup) findings may occur by chance, requiring a need for supportive evidence from observational epidemiologic studies of the agent (where available), mechanistic studies, or results of other related trials.
            Conclusions: Although chemoprevention of second cancers has been realized, it has become increasingly apparent that not all benefit equally. The finding of subgroup effects in completed trials results in the need to consider such subgroup effects in the design of future trials, by either restricting enrollment to particular subgroups (e.g., never or former smokers), or by increasing sample size requirements to allow for variation in response in subgroups in a statistically powerful way.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The leading cause of death in patients who have had curatively treated early-stage head and neck cancer is a second primary cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract (lung, esophagus, larynx, pharynx, and oral cavity cancers). Low fruit and vegetable intake has been associated with increased risk of primary head and neck cancer and the available data suggest that increasing intake following diagnosis may reduce the risk of a second primary cancer. The goal of this study was to develop and test an easily administered intervention to increase fruit and vegetable intake in these patients following diagnosis and treatment. The 6-month intervention was based on the Stage of Change model. Seventy-five early-stage head and neck cancer patients were randomized to either the intervention group or to the “blinded” control group, with diet change data available on 65 patients. Fruit and vegetable intake, assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, and plasma carotenoid concentrations were measured at baseline and at the end of the study period. The change in self-reported intake of fruit and vegetables (servings per day) over the study period was significantly greater (P = 0.009) in the intervention group (n = 35; +2.1) compared with the control group (n = 30; +0.5). Total plasma carotenoids, a biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake, increased by 70 nmol/L in the intervention group as compared with a reduction of 42 nmol/L in the control group, a relative difference of 12\% (nonsignificant). An intervention that can be delivered in a physician's office resulted in a significant increase in intake of fruit and vegetables in early-stage head and neck cancer patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) is a validated assessment instrument for nutritional problems, but its length limits its usefulness for screening. We sought to develop a screening version of this instrument, the MNA-SF, that retains good diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: We reanalyzed data from France that were used to develop the original MNA and combined these with data collected in Spain and New MEXICO: Of the 881 subjects with complete MNA data, 151 were from France, 400 were from Spain, and 330 were from New MEXICO: Independent ratings of clinical nutritional status were available for 142 of the French subjects. Overall, 73.8\% were community dwelling, and mean age was 76.4 years. Items were chosen for the MNA-SF on the basis of item correlation with the total MNA score and with clinical nutritional status, internal consistency, reliability, completeness, and ease of administration.
RESULTS: After testing multiple versions, we identified an optimal six-item MNA-SF total score ranging from 0 to 14. The cut-point score for MNA-SF was calculated using clinical nutritional status as the gold standard (n = 142) and using the total MNA score (n = 881). The MNA-SF was strongly correlated with the total MNA score (r = .945). Using an MNA-SF score of {\textgreater} or = 11 as normal, sensitivity was 97.9\%, specificity was 100\%, and diagnostic accuracy was 98.7\% for predicting undernutrition.
CONCLUSIONS: The MNA-SF can identify persons with undernutrition and can be used in a two-step screening process in which persons, identified as "at risk" on the MNA-SF, would receive additional assessment to confirm the diagnosis and plan interventions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A short battery of physical performance tests was used to assess lower extremity function in more than 5,000 persons age 71 years and older in three communities.
METHODS: Balance, gait, strength, and endurance were evaluated by examining ability to stand with the feet together in the side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem positions, time to walk 8 feet, and time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position 5 times.
RESULTS: A wide distribution of performance was observed for each test. Each test and a summary performance scale, created by summing categorical rankings of performance on each test, were strongly associated with self-report of disability. Both self-report items and performance tests were independent predictors of short-term mortality and nursing home admission in multivariate analyses. However, evidence is presented that the performance tests provide information not available from self-report items. Of particular importance is the finding that in those at the high end of the functional spectrum, who reported almost no disability, the performance test scores distinguished a gradient of risk for mortality and nursing home admission. Additionally, within subgroups with identical self-report profiles, there were systematic differences in physical performance related to age and sex.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that performance measures can validly characterize older persons across a broad spectrum of lower extremity function. Performance and self-report measures may complement each other in providing useful information about functional status.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measurement of fruit and vegetable intake is important in the surveillance of populations and in epidemiologic studies that examine the relations between diet and disease. Some situations require the use of brief dietary assessment tools.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the performance of 2 brief dietary assessment instruments, a 7-item standard screener and a new 16-item screener, and a complete food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in measuring total fruit and vegetable consumption.
DESIGN: About 800 men and women from the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study completed an FFQ, 1 of the 2 screeners, and two 24-h dietary recalls. Fruit and vegetable intakes as measured by each screener and the FFQ were compared with estimated true usual intake by using a measurement-error model.
RESULTS: Median daily servings of fruit and vegetables were underestimated by both screeners. The estimated agreement between true intake and the screener was higher for the new screener than for the standard screener and was higher for women than for men. The estimated agreement between true intake and the FFQ was higher than that for both screeners. Attenuation coefficients for the FFQ and screeners were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: For estimating median intakes of fruit and vegetables and the prevalence of recommended intakes being met, the use of screeners without appropriate adjustment is suboptimal. For estimating relative risks in the relations between fruit and vegetable intake and disease, screeners and this FFQ are similar in performance.},

The "All-Day" screener asks frequency and portion size questions about 9 food items. The "By-Meal" screener is similar, except that it asks about 2 of those 9 food items in terms of mealtime.
DESIGN: Survey participants completed 4 telephone-administered 24-hour dietary recalls over 1 year, a self-administered FFQ 1 to 2 months later, and 1 of 2 self-administered screeners after an additional 7 months.
SUBJECTS/SETTING: Participating were 202 men and 260 women aged 20 to 70 years living throughout the United States.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Fruit and vegetable intakes measured by each screener and the FFQ were compared with true usual intake based on a measurement error model with 24-hour dietary recalls as the reference instrument.
RESULTS: Estimates of median daily servings of fruit and vegetables were as follows: For men: True intake (5.8) vs All-Day screener (5.0), By-Meal screener (5.5), and FFQ (6.6); for women: true intake (4.2) vs All-Day screener (5.0), By-Meal screener (5.4), and FFQ (6.2). Estimated correlations between the test instruments and true intake were as follows: For men: All-Day screener (0.66), By-Meal screener (0.67), FFQ (0.68); for women: All-Day screener (0.51), By-Meal screener (0.53), and FFQ (0.54).
APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Both screeners might be useful to estimate median intakes of fruit and vegetable servings in US populations, but they might be less useful in accurately ranking individuals. More research is needed before using the screeners in ethnic or low-literacy populations.},

	abstract = {The reliability and concurrent validity of a simple questionnaire to assess leisure time physical activity has been investigated on 306 self-selected healthy adults of both sexes (163 M; 143 F). Values of body fat (BF) and maximum oxygen intake (VO2 max) expressed as percentiles of appropriate age and sex categories were used as criteria of validity for the questionnaire. BF and VO2 max were predicted from the Durnin and Womersley skinfold equations, and the laboratory version of the Canadian Home Fitness Test respectively. The strongest correlation was between VO2 max (percentile) and reported strenuous exercise (r = 0.35). The optimum discriminant function for VO2 max was based on a combination of reported strenuous and light activity. This yielded a correct 2-way classification of 69\% of the subjects. A combination of sweat-inducing and moderate exercise yielded a correct 2-way classification of BF for 66\% of subjects. The reliability coefficients for the optimum discriminant functions classifying VO2 max and BF were 0.83 and 0.85 respectively. We conclude that this simple instrument has potential value for the assessment of leisure time exercise behavior, offering the possibility of examining changes in behavior following the implementation of health and physical fitness promotion programmes in the community.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The goal of this investigation was to examine the relationship between, and application of, two disease specific quality of life (QL) measures currently being employed for head and neck cancer patients: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck Scale (FACT-H\&N) and the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN).
METHODS: The FACT-H\&N and PSS-HN were administered to 151 head and neck cancer patients with a range of disease sites, treatment status (on vs. off treatment), and treatment modalities (surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy).
RESULTS: FACT-H\&N subscale and total scores and PSS-HN subscale scores proved sensitive to patients groups (showed significant and clinically meaningful differences) on the basis of treatment status (on vs. off treatment) and global performance status (Karnofsky scores). The pattern of correlations between FACT-H\&N and PSS-HN subscales supported the scales' construct (convergent vs. divergent) validity. The strongest and most significant associations were observed between PSS-HN Normalcy of Diet and Eating in Public, and the head and neck subscale (HNS) of FACT-H\&N, both of which were designed to measure the unique problems of head and neck cancer patients. More modest associations were observed between subscales measuring physical and functional areas of performance, social functioning, and emotional well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: The FACT-HNS was found to be reliable and valid when applied to head and neck cancer patients. It clearly adds information to that collected by the parent (core) instrument. The PSS-HN also provides unique information, independent of that provided by the Karnofsky or the FACT-H\&N. This study supported the multidimensional nature of QL for head and neck cancer patients, and thus the importance of assessing disease specific concerns in addition to general health status when assessing functional and QL outcome.},

              Purpose
              This study aimed to examine psychometric properties of a caregiver version of the well-established Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Scale (FACT-G) after conducting focus groups and obtaining expert input.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We made minor wording modifications to the Patient FACT-G to enable caregivers to report how the illness affected their overall quality of life (QOL) and well-being on four subscales (physical, social, emotional, functional). We tested the acceptability, precision, factor structure, reliability and validity of the Caregiver FACT-G among partners of prostate cancer patients (
                N
                 = 263) and caregivers (spouses, siblings, adult children) of patients with advanced cancer (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate) (
                N
                 = 484) using data from two Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs).
              
            
            
              Results
              With a factor structure similar to the Patient FACT-G, Caregiver FACT-G was acceptable and precise in measuring caregiver QOL, with high inter-factor correlations and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alphas 0.81–0.91). The Caregiver FACT-G had strong convergent validity demonstrated by significant positive correlations with caregiver self-efficacy (0.25–0.63), dyadic communication (0.18–0.51), and social support (0.18–0.54) in both samples. It also had strong discriminant validity evidenced by significant inverse correlations with negative appraisal of caregiving (− 0.37 to − 0.69), uncertainty (− 0.28 to − 0.53), hopelessness (− 0.25 to − 0.60), and avoidant coping (− 0.26 to − 0.58) in both samples. Caregivers’ baseline FACT-G scores were significantly associated with their physical (0.23) and mental well-being (0.54; 4-month follow-up) and their depression (− 0.69; 3-month follow-up), indicating strong predictive validity.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This is the first study evaluating the psychometric properties of the Caregiver FACT-G. More psychometric testing is warranted, especially among caregivers of diverse sociocultural backgrounds.},

              Patients diagnosed with cancer face many challenges and need a good understanding of their diagnosis and proposed treatments to make informed decisions about their care. Health literacy plays an important role in this and low health literacy has been associated with poorer outcomes. The aims of this review are to identify which outcomes relate to health literacy in patients with cancer, and to combine this through a mixed studies approach with the patient experience as described through qualitative studies.
            
            
              Methods
              Four electronic databases were searched in January 2021 to identify records relating to health literacy and patients with cancer. Records were independently screened then assessed for inclusion by two reviewers according to the following criteria: patients aged ≥18 years with cancer, English language publication AND health literacy measured with validated tool and measured outcome associated with health literacy OR qualitative study exploring the role of health literacy as patients make decisions about health. Quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. A narrative synthesis was performed, and findings integrated through concept mapping. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO, entry CRD42020166454.
            
            
              Results
              4441 records were retrieved. Following de-duplication, 2496 titles and abstracts were screened and full texts of 405 papers were reviewed for eligibility. 66 papers relating to 60 studies met the eligibility criteria. Lower health literacy was associated with greater difficulties understanding and processing cancer related information, poorer quality of life and poorer experience of care. Personal and situational influences contributed to how participants processed information and reached decisions about their care.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This review highlights the important role of health literacy for patients with cancer. Outcomes are poorer for those who experience difficulties with health literacy. Further efforts should be made to facilitate understanding, develop health literacy and support patients to become more involved in their care.},

METHODS: Through analysis of current findings in medical and public health literature on health literacy we derived a conceptual causal model.
RESULTS: Health literacy should be viewed as both a patient and a system phenomenon. Three distinct points along a continuum of health care are suggested to be influenced by health literacy: (1) access and utilization of health care, (2) patient-provider relationship, and (3) self-care.
CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual model organizes what has been learned to date and underscores promising areas of future inquiry and intervention.},

	abstract = {Background
Understanding the knowledge, attitudes, and practices pertaining to food insecurity among oncology registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) is critical to ensuring that cancer survivors have adequate nutrition—a fundamental component of successful treatment and recovery.
Objective
To qualitatively assess oncology RDNs’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding the food access needs of their patients using a qualitative semantic approach to thematic analysis.
Design
The qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2018 to January 2019.
Participants and setting
Forty-one oncology RDNs working with cancer survivors in various clinical settings across the United States participated.
Main outcome measures
Participants completed a semistructured, in-depth interview via telephone, lasting an average of 49 minutes.
Statistical analyses performed
Two coders (primary and secondary) trained in qualitative thematic data analysis methods used a semantic approach to thematic analysis to analyze transcripts. A qualitative and mixed methods online coding program Dedoose was used to organize and analyze the data.
Results
Participants defined food insecurity (FI) as a lack of access to nutritious foods and a lack of resources to purchase nutritious foods. RDNs stated they believe FI is a serious problem in the United Staes, has a greater influence on cancer survivors than healthy individuals and they have specific concerns about FI among their own patients. Despite their concerns, most expressed that they do not use a validated tool to identify FI, nor were they aware that any exists. Only a small proportion of the RDNs stated that they regularly ask patients about their food access needs.
Conclusions
Although Oncology RDNs have heard of FI, they do not routinely assess patients’ food security status with a validated tool, nor do they consistently ask patients directly about their food access needs. These findings suggest there is a need for developing education and training opportunities for oncology RDNs to enhance their ability to screen for and address FI with their patients.},

	abstract = {Dose-response modeling in occupational epidemiology is usually motivated by questions of causal inference (eg, is there a monotonic increase of risk with increasing exposure?) or risk assessment (eg, how much excess risk exists at any given level of exposure?). We focus on several approaches to dose-response in occupational cohort studies. Categorical analyses are useful for detecting the shape of dose-response. However, they depend on the number and location of cutpoints and result in step functions rather than smooth curves. Restricted cubic splines and penalized splines are useful parametric techniques that provide smooth curves. Although splines can complement categorical analyses, they do not provide interpretable parameters. The shapes of these curves will depend on the degree of "smoothing" chosen by the analyst. We recommend combining categorical analyses and some type of smoother, with the goal of developing a reasonably simple parametric model. A simple parametric model should serve as the goal of dose-response analyses because (1) most "true" exposure response curves in nature may be reasonably simple, (2) a simple parametric model is easily communicated and used by others, and (3) a simple parametric model is the best tool for risk assessors and regulators seeking to estimate individual excess risks per unit of exposure. We discuss these issues and others, including whether the best model is always the one that fits the best, reasons to prefer a linear model for risk in the low-exposure region when conducting risk assessment, and common methods of calculating excess lifetime risk at a given exposure from epidemiologic results (eg, from rate ratios). Points are illustrated using data from a study of dioxin and cancer.},
